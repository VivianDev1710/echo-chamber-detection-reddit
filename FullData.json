                    "It is valid to try to treat a pregnancy similar to a case of self defense when it is life threatening since a lethal threat can merit a lethal response in defense of life. The problem is that they try to use bodily autonomy to say that any unwanted pregnancy at all is essentially assault against the mother and gives her the right to use lethal force against the developing human, but trying to treat it as a self defense argument requires that the force used not be higher than a realistic perception of the threat based on the information known at the time the action in self defense was taken. Since abortion is a pre scheduled thing overseen by medical staff after a medical exam to assess the situation, they know for a fact that there is not any lethal threat to the life or long term health of the mother at the time the abortion is being performed in the vast majority of cases, so it is entirely unjustified to respond with lethal force that is far greater than the \"threat\" it is use against.",
                    "Self-defense is tricky, but I think there is a decent argument to made that it could be allowed in just about any pregnancy. \n\nThe first thing is that, in general, the least amount of force has to be used to eliminate the threat. Before viability, there is no non-lethal way to end pregnancy. Here's a story to illustrate what I'm getting at. If some guy said he was going to teach me a lesson and started a fist fight, that probably isn't enough to allow me to use lethal force, especially if I'm bigger, or I have an easy avenue of escape. However, say we have the same scenario, but the victim is physically disabled. They are carrying a gun, but otherwise have no ability to defend or escape. Do they need for the other person to be threatening their life in order to use lethal self-defense, or is the other person threatening to knock out their teeth enough justification?\n\nPregnancies are rarely life-threatening. However, nearly all will cause harm, and the possibility of a serious injury is decently likely. The question is how possible does a severe injury have to be to make lethal self-defense justifiable?",
                    "If all pregnancies are life-threatening, driving a car is basically a death sentence.  \n\nAll pregnancies are stressful, uncomfortable, and painful, but in the modern word *very, very few* women die.  \n\nMaternal mortality rates in the US are absolutely a disgrace when you consider that other developed counties are doing so much better, but that\u2019s about *relative* risk, not absolute risk.",
                    "In the US, the pregnancy death rate is around 0.016%. It's about the same chance the average American has of dying from a car crash during an arbitrary 40-week period. Make of it what you will. Calculated from 2020:\n\nThere were about [3,600,000 live births](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm) in the US in 2020, roughly [800,000 abortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_statistics_in_the_United_States), and roughly [875,000 miscarriages](https://www.livescience.com/50790-miscarriage-misconceptions.html), for an estimated total of 5,275,000 pregnancies. There were [861 maternal deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm) that same year.\n\nTheir \"maternal death\" definition:\n\n    \u201cthe death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes\u201d\n\nWorks out to about a 0.016% chance of dying from a pregnancy.",
                    "The way they throw around the word life-threatening is why I pretty much ignore it now. Don't get me wrong, I understand there's a very *tiny* amount of pregnant women that have legitimate risk of death when pregnant or giving birth. But that is so low it's not a reason to just flippantly be like \"Let women kill their babies!\" I've heard people who are pro-abortion use excuses such as body dysmorphia, they don't feel like their old body so of course the only thing to do is to kill the baby. Or illness like being sick for 9 months. And I understand some women really do just have massive morning sickness, all day throwing up, for all 9 months I have met women like that. Not a reason to kill your baby. So I can't even take them seriously anymore.",
                    "By that reasoning all sex is life threatening. Maybe we can convince these folks that they should avoid that at all costs.",
                    "This is also an attempt to further embed the mindset that pregnancy is a curse - scaring, frightening women to have children that prevalent amongst Millennials and Gen Z. It turns children into commodities and a burden.",
                    "Younger millennial here. \u270b And unfortunately I almost fell into that mindset. Deep down I always wanted to be a wife and mother but anytime I ever said that out loud people would act as if I said I liked to murder puppies. Even men that I dated would get angry at me for saying I wanted to be a stay-at-home wife and mom. They would call me a disgrace of a female, that I am setting women back a hundred years. My own mother told me to never, ever, ever, have children. That their burdens, they ruin your life, they ruin your body, nothing will ever be the same, that having kids is the *worst* thing you can do. My mother even supports abortion it would be fine if I said I wanted one. \n\n All my mother and aunts told me was how horrible being pregnant/having children was and the majority then told me I damn well better never become a stay-at-home wife. It was also reinforced in Me by pretty much everyone on both sides of my family that I would never make a good mother, I would never be able to do it, or handle it. So for about ten years I started to believe \"Okay, I guess having kids really *is* that bad.\" But I knew deep down inside what I wanted I just figured I was wrong for wanting that and I would just have to get over it. So I buried it. On top of the depression I already had it got worse and worse. I was in horrible relationships because any man who wanted that kind of life I assumed was also wrong, like how I was, and I pushed him away. The climax was when I was with a horrible man who had two daughters. I loved being around them but anytime I tried to get close to them he would make me feel bad for it, and he'd make me feel bad for wanting to bake homemade bread so the kids had healthy food and wanting to make him dinner. He would constantly demean me because I didn't have any big life goals to want to own my own company or something. When asked about my life goals from him or others the only thing I could come up with was I wanted a house with a garden and a couple of goats and a husband and some kids (but of course I started leaving the kids part out because GOD FORBID I say that) I got suicidal so I got into therapy and tried to figure out what was \"wrong\" with me. *I shouldn't want to have a family! I should want to work sixty hours a week and be a girl boss like my mom but I want to die.* Is what I kept repeating in therapy. I finally learned to just accept that what I want is natural. And now I have the most amazing man who wants to make me a stay-at-home mom more than anything. We're getting married in 6 months and we're planning on two kids, maybe even three if we can swing it. And we want to foster children too. I almost fell for all that bull crap and lies. That's not to say if someone wants that life they shouldn't have it. 100%, go for it! But it was lies to me, for me. And thank God I found the truth before it was too late.",
                    "Children have been \"commodities\" for a very long time, thanks to the adoption industry, and now with surrogacy and IVF.\n\nACB did say \"domestic supply of infants,\" in her opinion, for the Dobbs Decision.\n\nFar too many Millennials are one bad day away from homelessness, that's why there was a decline in the birth rate, they can barely afford their own basic necessities,  much less for a child, and they wanted them as much as all prior generations, they didn't have the economy.\n\nIt's not that they are a burden, they can't afford them, even with both parents working full-time. I blame Reagonomics.",
                    "True, but I'll note that some Pro-Lifers do the same thing in the opposite direction: they like to insist that every pregnancy is viable cause there's a chance doctor wrong, chance of miracle, etc.\n\nI think it goes both ways. A sufficiently low probability is negligible, and a sufficiently high probability is a certainty.",
                    "It's comin' right for us!",
                    "some pregnancies are life threatening but not all and their are exceptions for those who do. The idea that abortion bans kill women is just absurd",
                    "Secular pro-life is misrepresenting pro-choicers. They are not saying that every or even most pregnancies are life-threatening.  \n\nThey are saying that, recently, there have been women with life-threatening pregnancies who were denied abortions as a result of pro-life laws in some states of the United States.\n\nLike these women:\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/texas-women-testify-in-lawsuit-claiming-abortion-restrictions-put-their-lives-in-jeopardy \n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/11/16/health/abortion-texas-sepsis/index.html\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/health/doctors-weigh-litigation-miscarriage-care/index.html",
                    "This is in reference to the Texas cases in which the woman's life is not in danger due to the pregnancy. Trisomy 18 does not threaten the life of the mother and hence she cannot get an abortion by the testimony of her own doctor.",
                    "These were entirely unclear if they were cases of the law actually making it so that is how it has to be, and not just the doctors using ignorance of the law as an excuse to deny the treatment or as an attempted strike trying to push to change the law by not performing removal of an already deceased body or abortions in the rare case the mother's life is at risk if the laws aren't expanded to allow more abortions. What is the actual wording of the laws these are saying are too restrictive and do those laws really require these restrictions?\n\nMost of the pointing at the pro-life laws being too restrictive that I've seen end up turning out like the case where it was found that it was entirely legal for a young girl who was raped to have had an abortion in her home state but the doctor refused despite it being entirely legal and they ended up getting the abortion in a different state. Are these actually because the way the law is written or just cases of doctors being ignorant of or trying to boycott the law because they want to go back to allowing more entirely elective not at all medically necessary abortions that are just used as a backup for failed or not correctly used birth control?"

                    "Plers, who does the uterus belong to?  State?  Church?  The woman's parents?  The male partner?  Because if she doesn't get to dictate what goes in and out of it, then basically you don't think she owns her body part.",
                    "One thing I see from the PL side fairly often that I wanted to address relates to bodily autonomy being used as a defense for abortion. I often see PLers referring to the idea that no/very few women cite bodily autonomy as the reason that they're choosing to abort. Instead, they cite things like financial reasons, career goals, relationship issues, etc. They pretty much never say \"it's because my bodily autonomy is violated\" when they're answering surveys or filling out forms. And on its surface, this can theoretically make it seem like the bodily autonomy defense falls flat. \n\nBut I'd encourage any PLers making this argument (or encountering it from others on your side) to consider that the reasons for someone not wanting a bodily autonomy invasion and the justification for said bodily autonomy invasion being wrong are not and need not be the same. It's easiest to understand if you consider another very common bodily autonomy invasion: rape. For the purposes of making this point, I'm going to oversimplify rape by considering it unwanted sex (which doesn't cover all rape).  And no, I'm not suggesting a fetus is a rapist with this argument, so let's not waste our time and go there. I'm also going to use a heteronormative framing for simplicity and clarity. \n\nThere are many reasons that any given woman might not want to have sex with any given man at any given time. Some of them will seem very serious, like if she has trauma from a prior rape, she has health issues that make sex painful or dangerous, she doesn't want to risk an unplanned pregnancy, or she's saving her virginity for her religion. Some may seem more frivolous, like she doesn't want to mess up her hair for an upcoming event, or she's in the middle of watching a very good TikTok, or he said something that reminded her of SpongeBob and now she has the ick. \n\nBut when it comes to sex, we (hopefully) all understand that her reason doesn't matter. If she doesn't want to have sex for *any* reason, and he does it anyhow, then it's rape, and it's wrong. It's just as wrong if she doesn't want sex because she'd rather not be all sweaty right now since she was planning to take a super cute selfie as it would be if she doesn't want sex because her partner is abusive and she's repulsed by his touch. If he has sex with her in either case it's rape. And rape is wrong because of the bodily autonomy violation. \n\nThe same logic applies when considering unwanted pregnancies. It doesn't matter why the woman doesn't want to be pregnant. If she's forced to carry her pregnancy to term, it violates her bodily autonomy regardless. \n\nAnd maybe you feel that the bodily autonomy violation in pregnancy is justified, but consider that that's a separate argument. Her bodily autonomy is violated the same no matter what.",
                    "I've had to make this point repeatedly as well. \n\nThe reason you do something is separate from your right to do it.",
                    "Plus, women are *used* to having to give reasons beyond \"I don't want to (BA)\". \n\nYou can't just say, \"No I don't want sex,\" to your partner; you need to be sick or tired or angry.\n\nYou can't just say, \"No I don't want to go out with you,\" to an acquaintance; you need to be in a relationship, be too busy, or not interested in dating rn.\n\nWe all know what happens when women just say \"no\". We've been socially conditioned to either say \"yes\" or say \"no\" without saying actually it, because otherwise we fucking die! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
                    "I appreciate you saying this, because I do think I've had some debates on here where we were talking past each other for this reason. If I can make a similar \"appeal\" from the PL side:\n\nI don't think I (and I assume many other PLers) was ever arguing that any given reason would be a \"bad\" or \"good\" reason for an individual person to make an individual choice that is actually hers to make (such as sex, as you brought up, or pregnancy, according to the PC worldview). But I have often found myself wanting (and probably failing, in the moment) to say with clarity: These motivations for individual abortions, while weighty and deserving of attention, are not sufficient to justify legalizing killing persons. They rely on stronger reasoning (bodily autonomy and/or \"not a person\" arguments) to justify legalizing the killing. So if that stronger reasoning *does* justify legalizing it, they're unnecessary (you should be able to get an abortion for any reason whatsoever). If that stronger reasoning *does not* justify legalizing it, they're insufficient (we don't kill toddlers for those kinds of reasons). So either way, those individual motivations don't help answer the central question, \"should abortion be legal?\" even if they are relevant for other reasons. So I think they often feel like a frustrating divergence from the heart of the disagreement, or rarely, even a bad-faith deflection from it.",
                    "In intact abortions, the unborn die because they cannot maintain their own life support systems like born people can. That. Is. It. They don't die from the procedure itself, they die from natural causes. Period. Case closed.",
                    "Tell me more about how newborns are completely self sufficient. How about severe dementia patients. The mentally ill. Really old people. What should we do with them? Kill them, or take care of them?",
                    "If someone wants to continue a pregnancy to term, they should have the right to do that.\n\nIf someone wants to terminate a pregnancy, they should also have the right to do that.\n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t want to become pregnant, they should be provided the resources to prevent it.\n\nAnd if someone wants to be a parent, they should be given the help they need.",
                    "For pro-lifers - what properties would an AI have to have for you to consider it a moral patient (i.e. a being whose interests matter morally)? For example, would it have to be conscious, or to have been conscious in the past?",
                    "Obviously I\u2019m not a pro lifer, but I wanted to respond to this anyway as it\u2019s an interesting question. \n\nIf an AI is conscious, AI would be the wrong word. It would not be an artificial intelligence, it would be a conscious entity. For it to be a moral patient, we would need to have reasonable motivation to consider that the consciousness is not merely procedural and then victim to a Chinese Room problem. If this condition is reached, and if the entity in question has non trivial self identification, in that it can distinguish itself as \u201cI\u201d, then it would be beyond doubt that it is a moral entity!\n\nHowever\u2026. There is always the Philip K Dick question that always plagues my mind about these things. One of the core issues in \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\u201d, otherwise adapted as Blade Runner, is to ask does it really make a difference if the entity was purely procedural? If the entity behaved exactly as what one would expect of a conscious being to behave, does it really matter if it is virtual or real? Is being virtual any less real? Every time I believe I\u2019ve come to grips with this question, I always fall back into doubt."

We need the mental health days to reflect and mourn on the loss of life. We need a day or two (paid) to flagellate ourselves because our faulty uterine lining didn\u2019t have Velcro super powers. \n\nWe lost a life that has intrinsic value!

Both can be referred to as babies. This is why scientific language is important to use to distinguish the life stages. Killing an infant is infanticide and murder.

They seen surrendering control of their reproductive decisions as not only acceptable but holy, at least when it is surrendered to her husband.  For some, they would even be okay with a government mandate that every married couple tries for at least five children if they thought that government was sufficiently religious.\n\nThe more typical PL leaning woman, the kind that probably is not going to debate on reddit but also won\u2019t argue when her pastor talks about the evils of abortion, is already being turned off by the PL stance, and only getting more alienated.

But because SUBJECTIVELY given the situation I value her more than others. \n\nSo yeah, the kid is a no brainer because there is suffering to be experienced and many PLer would say that sub 20 weeks there is no sentience. You bring the age of the blastocysts up and the quality of life for the living child down, then my subjective opinion will change.",
                    "So essentially this is the burning IVF clinic scenario repackaged. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, it\u2019s a relatively well known hypothetical where an IVF clinic is burning, and similar to this one, you have to choose whether to save a baby trapped inside or some multiple numbers of embryos.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this thought experiment. First, whenever you\u2019re forcing a binary like this, it only tells you about what the respondent personally values more, and does not indicate that the respondent ascribes no value to the other choice. It\u2019s perfectly possible that someone could choose to save the infant while also sincerely believing the embryos have equivalent moral status. \n\nYou may say, how can the respondent think they have equivalent moral status if they will save only one baby vs. five? That\u2019s because the second problem is that this analogy is designed to provoke an emotional response, rather than a logical one. You can change this in lots of different ways and get different answers. For example, if it\u2019s my one child vs. 5, 10, or 100 strangers I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m choosing my child every time, easily. This is because I have an emotional attachment to my child. Someone with a more objective would probably choose to save the group with multiple people over my child. So all we can really learn from this is that we are more emotionally attached to infants than blastocysts. They\u2019re visibly much closer to looking like us. We see cute babies in the arms of their loving parents all the time. We never see blastocysts, and they\u2019re not particularly cute. But if we\u2019re to do a logical assessment of why we value the life of a newborn, many if not all of those reasons apply to blastocysts. We need to rise above emotional instinctual responses like the one this hypothetical is attempting to elicit, and instead apply reason",

                    "what\u2019s the next response if someone like myself bites the bullet and has the intuition we should save the 5 blastocysts?",
                    "Just an observation:\n\nIf something is one's actual moral \"intuition\", you wouldn't call that response \"biting the bullet.\"  A moral \"intuition\" is a strong, immediate belief about a moral situation that comes to a person without thinking about it logically. \"Biting the bullet\" is resolving to accept something unpleasant, or that you have been hesitating over. \n\nIn a moral discussion, you usually refer to *rejecting* a moral intuition as \"biting the bullet.\" It seems oddly contradictory to me that you would say \"My moral intuition is that I should save the 5 blastocysts,\" and then call that position \"biting the bullet.\" If your moral \"intuition\" was that saving the 5 blastocysts was the right thing to do, but you then applied some reasoning to the situation and decided that your moral \"intuition\" was inconsistent, you would *then* be \"biting the bullet\" by accepting the wrongness of your intuitive position and concluding that you should save the born infant.\n\nThe opposite position would be that your moral \"intuition\" was to save the infant, but you then \"bite the bullet\" to conclude that the morally consistent position was to save the blastocysts.",

Here are my answers to your questions: \n\n>1) Do you think she should\u2019ve been allowed an abortion in her home state of Texas in this case?\n\nBottom line: No, I don't think she qualifies for the maternal health exception under the law.\n\nI do think this is a particularly fraught case.  From a moral perspective, my view is that if the fetus is certain to die during pregnancy or soon thereafter, then I think abortion is tragic but acceptable in that situation.  But here, the fetus is *likely* but not *certain* to die, making this case especially difficult.  \n\nFrom a legal perspective, the case centers not on the fetus' likelihood of survival but the woman's eligibility for the maternal health exception.  As a general matter I think these exceptions should be construed narrowly so that they do not effectively become loopholes.  She seems to be basing her eligibility on potential impacts to her future fertility or potential pregnancy complications, but these harms are in my view pretty speculative.  Further, many of the potential pregnancy complications highlighted in her complaint, like gestational diabetes, are not that unusual, and don't seem to rise to the level of a \"life-threatening physical condition,\" which is what the law requires.  The state Supreme Court, which sided with the AG, noted in its ruling that the woman's doctor *did not even assert* that she has a life-threatening physical condition. Frankly, this was rookie lawyering.  (I am a lawyer.)\n\n>2) Do you think the Texas AG acted in a way that was harmful to Ms Cox or do you agree with him and his threats?\n\nI did not follow the play-by-play of press conferences and Twitter posts, but big picture: The Attorney General's duty is to faithfully enforce the law.  If he believes she does not qualify for the exception then he should enforce the law and prevent her from getting an abortion.  Further, if he believes a trial court reached an incorrect interpretation of the law, he should appeal that decision to a higher court.  This is how the legal process works.  \n\n>3) Do you think she should be punished for traveling out of state for an abortion? 3a) Do you think laws should be changed so that women cannot leave states for abortions?\n\nI don't think states have the constitutional authority to criminalize or limit interstate travel. \n\n>4) What would you do if this was you? What about if it was your daughter? Would you encourage her to risk her life and fertility or would you believe her want for an abortion is justified?\n\nI have no idea how I would personally react in this situation, but it would be largely out of my hands.  At bottom, this is a legal dispute about the scope of the statutory maternal health exception.  The law has been in effect for only a short period of time and the courts have not really had the opportunity to construe the statute until now.  \n\n* * * \nBecause I answered your questions I would like to address the rest of your post, which impugns PLers en masse for supposedly not engaging to your satisfaction on this sub.

How would killing her twin babies have saved anyone's life?\n\n>So, PLers, my question is, how was this better than an abortion?\n\nIt's better to protect the right to life of these twins than to let them be killed because the former is to disregard their human rights, which constitutes dehumanization. The latter is to acknowledge their human rights, specifically their right to life.\n\nThe latter is better than the former because the very purpose of the law is to protect the rights of those within its jurisdiction. Were these twins allowed to be killed, the law would be failing.\n\n>Being unable to breathe is not a peaceful experience\n\nTrue. That this manner of death was expected for the babies doesn't take away their right to life.\n\n>And we don't know how long it will take them to financially recover, or if they ever will.\n\nIt was once argued that slavery was necessary for farmers who didn't want to experience financial suffering. It turns out that finances don't take away other peoples' rights. No amount of financial suffering justifies owning slaves or killing babies.\n\n>Pregnant patients back then would have done anything for ultrasounds and abortions, to prevent the birth of newborns whose bodies never had a chance. It's insane that we have that now, and we're not allowed to benefit from it.\n\nIf we're not allowed to benefit from modern medical technology, then how do you think we shrunk the maternal mortality rate to 0.02%? Before we had this technology, it was more like 10%, and still is in places without this technology. Do you seriously think that all of pregnancy-related technology, technique, and medicine is about killing babies?",

How would killing her twin babies have saved anyone's life?\n\nIt would have saved suffering from not only her and her family from not having to go through such a traumatic event, but also the now born babies who just suffered until death. There is a much more humane way of dying instead of suffering and that would be an abortion, if by logic the woman is sedated for an abortion then wouldn't the fetus also be, since they get everything the woman does?

I get it \u2026 but it really boggles my mind that there are people who are just fine debating how this woman isn\u2019t sick enough for the abortion. These aren\u2019t her medical providers, they aren\u2019t even medical providers (the vast majority), they\u2019ve just \u201cread\u201d something. They aren\u2019t her spiritual advisers, her family, or her husband, and yet they want to punish her for not being willing to jeopardize her life  and health for an fetus that will most likely died before it\u2019s born and will suffer a slow torturous death after. If that is writers\u2019 moral code, fine. But that isn\u2019t this woman\u2019s. \n\nOne of my friends had to early deliver a fetus not compatible with life. She was right at 20 weeks. The hell she went through\u2026 I cannot describe it.  And in the midst of this tragedy, the kind that is some of the worst moments of their lives, the state comes in and dictates how to handle it. \n\nHow would they like if the state came in and said, sorry you can\u2019t let grandma go, she\u2019s got to suffer until nature takes her.\n\nDo PL understand that for many of us, there are fates worse than death and living that is no life.\n\nMy mother has CP. her entire life has been devoted to the disabled.

It shouldn't have been, but it has. Two women facing the devastating pain (physical and emotional) of losing a wanted pregnancy through no fault of their own, and the PL movement wants them imprisoned for it. Wants to compound and extend their grief. And it won't help the fetuses. It never would have. It just serves to hurt and punish the women.\n\nAnd I've seen them try to justify it. In this case, there are tons of PLers who are minimizing or ignoring the risks to Kate's life and her health (or making very ignorant statements because they don't have a medical background, such as that she could do a VBAC since they know someone else who did). They also minimize the severity of the syndrome affecting her fetus, which means it has a 95% likelihood of dying in utero before term (so it isn't just disabled or imperfect, as I see repeatedly claimed). And with Brittany they were mostly revealing their ignorance of miscarriages or making unfounded accusations about Brittany's character and behavior (often clearly rooted in racism and/or misogyny). \n\nBasically they have to twist themselves in knots, lie, and exaggerate, and they still can't really defend the idea that these women belong in prison or that imprisoning them helps any babies at all\n\nIt's unspeakably cruel.",

                    "Ectopic pregnancies, rape, incest, babies that are genetically so damaged that they will never be able to actually live, etc etc. With laws being passed women literally have to become septic before it\u2019s their life before the \u201cbaby\u2019s\u201d even when the fetus was nonviable from the start. It puts womens lives at risk and protects no one. For every first world country that has protected abortion rights we see a rise in overall standards for that country. In third would countries where abortion is banned it happens anyway because people who become pregnant who do not want to be pregnant will abort - safely or not. It\u2019s sheer statistics and medicine. Not to mention most of these abortions are happened before the fetus even has the synapses to process any type of pain, it\u2019s quite literally less quantifiably alive than a plant which sustains its own life function. Finally, you say a simple implant - implants absolutely do not work for everyone. The arm implant has huge risks for getting into circulation and killing you, I\u2019ve literally had friends who had to be rushed to the ER. Not to mention the scar tissue left behind and the fact that the hormones affect everyone differently. As for IUDs they are incredibly painful, women often experience different periods and discomfort. The copper one exponentially increases your period and there have been several medical complications with them throughout time. The hormonal ones back to square one - sometimes they make you feel great sometimes the hormones quite literally can send you into a deep depression, kill your libido, change your skin texture, acne, moods, bloating, weight gain, etc etc. Not to mention a lot of times you can feel the strings during sex and can literally accidentally pull it out. Do some real research on birth control and how it actually affects people. It\u2019s extremely personal because hormones affect everyone very differently. I literally started a birth control that made me sweat uncontrollably at night and have greasy hair 24/7, imagine that\u2019s what\u2019s stuck in your body? It\u2019s a lot more than here\u2019s an implant your good. And then finally you say that the fetus is a human being - is it?? The definition of life at conception quite literally means that organic matter has cellular life - by your definition you are a murderer because any plant or animal you eat is technically life by this definition. It does not actually signify real life. If you actually look at human development and the amount of fertilized eggs that never actually become humans you\u2019d have a different perspective. Not to mention you should have serious issues with the literally thousands of fertilized eggs in fertility centers around the world. Are these Han Solo frozen people? Or are they just fertilized eggs? The problem you actually have is with the idea of abortion because you have a skewed moral view of what is right. What is right, is protecting the life and body of the woman who is living life. She is alive, she\u2019s already guaranteed life. The conceptus could be lost at quite literally any moment, not to mention birth control just skips the implantation part a lot of the time, sending your precious fertilized eggs into the toilet, no more important than the other cells I shed each month. Abortion merely separates the mothers life support to a fetus that does not live or survive on its own, it\u2019s not alive in its own right at all. It\u2019s like a lamp plugged into the wall, it doesn\u2019t inherently have electricity but it uses it while plugged in.",
                    "I hear you about the rare instances in which abortion could seem more acceptable. However most abortions occur simply because a woman doesn\u2019t want to have a baby which I just don\u2019t see how that\u2019s justifiable. Because you don\u2019t want to give up 9 months of your time for a pregnancy you can just kill the baby? You deliver a baby no matter what - dead or alive. The implant is 99% effective, the pills are effective and condoms are effective when used properly. Women that aren\u2019t using these options and are actively having unprotected sex that seek abortions just gives me the ick. Put aside all of those rare cases that you mentioned even though they do happen I agree with that. Do you still think it\u2019s ok if a woman is having unprotected sex willingly and having multiple abortions as a form of birth control? I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s okay at all. I\u2019m thinking about the innocent person created because of the sexual act, this person is still a person no matter how many people try to claim that it\u2019s not. All oppressed groups in history were treated like nothing that could be exterminated such as Jewish people during the holocaust but then people recognized that was not right because they are people. Fetuses are people that have autonomy over their body and nobody has the right to kill them. Even if you were in your mothers womb temporarily she still didn\u2019t have the right to kill you.",

Barring any other factors, my dissatisfaction at an abortion grows the further along the pregnancy proceeds.  Unfortunately, there are always other factors of varying degrees of depth, impact and importance.  \n\nOne thing I believe to be true is that the abortion topic is not black and white, it is not straight-forward and easy.  Do some women make the choice nonchalantly? Probably.  But i suspect there are many for whom it is an excruciating decision. Who is right?\n\nFor me, all I can say is that if I were a woman I surely would not think it was anyone else's business what I do with my body.  It would be my decision and mine alone.  Afterwards, I would have to deal with all of the facets of the aftermath.  I am quite certain no one escapes from an emotional deluge with this act.",

It\u2019s not just some fifth-gen microchip with no repercussions that temporarily sterilises a womb, it\u2019s not magic. They ensue major hormonal changes to the woman, along with possible side effects of weight gain, mood changes, irregular and painful periods, infection, nausea, painful intercourse- the very reason for an IUD according to you too. Plus, athletes or other females who need their bodies functioning to their full will most likely not risk having an IUD altering their performance. Also, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and assume you\u2019re first world? Yeah, thought so. IUD insertion is not free where I live either- another first world country. This only begs the questions to areas with less resources or stigma around birth control. I wouldn\u2019t. Enough argument for you?",
                    "The same argument could be had about mandatory vasectomies for men versus birth control for women. Vasectomies are reversible, highly effective, have no observable side effects, and are covered by almost all insurance companies. Men are equally as responsible as women for *creating* a baby as they are for *preventing* one. If you want to make the argument that people should prevent pregnancy through birth control rather than abort, that's fine, but the prevention should come from both parties involved and not assume that women should hold all the responsibility. Additionally, there are better ways to prevent people from participating in abortions rather than taking them away entirely. Things like expanded sex education, increased funding for local clinics and planned parenthoods that *provide* the birth control you are talking about, or, crazy concept here, providing women with the resources they need to care for a child in the first place, (i.e. paid maternal leave, free/affordable childcare, or a program such as the one they use in Spain, referred to as the \"baby bonus\")  are known to be more effective in preventing abortions than its removal of as a whole. Taking away access does not get rid of abortions, it gets rid of *safe* abortions, and I think that it is crazy to frame this argument as if the life of a *potential* human takes precedence over the life of one that is already alive. If you don't like abortions, DONT GET ONE."

He doesn\u2019t know if this was a baby from rape or if the pregnancy is viable, clearly he doesn\u2019t even know anything about human gestation or development - a fetus quite literally cannot feel pain, it does not have any capacity to \u201crun away\u201d. This is nothing more than the emotional rhetoric of a clearly uneducated person. The doctor in the room had deemed this medically necessary, notice he didn\u2019t have a sonographer in the room yet and by his own account he had to rush to the operating room? Normal D&E procedures are scheduled. Clearly this man wasn\u2019t a doctor, he didn\u2019t read the chart, and he did not know what was going on. Seeing as he treated the woman as nothing but an incubator for this baby he had no idea if her life was in danger, if the pregnancy was even viable, etc etc. Clearly this was an emergency evacuation though and the doctor had cleared the surgery on an emergency basis for a reason. Notice the doctor is nothing but a villain? They do not talk at all? Usually in any procedure you have everyone involved communicating with each other. You also don\u2019t need to go to the operating room for a D&E usually. Soooo in summation, the facts show that this was an unexpected emergency where the doctors were moving quickly enough that they needed to rush a sonographer over who was not previously privy to the case, he gained no information to asses why the procedure was being performed (especially so quickly), he did not consider the woman on the table as his patient, and he jumped to conclusions without any actual evidence of what was happening."

                    "Nowhere does this day \"treat the life threatening pregnancy. The goal of this bill is to require doctors perform a scientifically impossible procedure. \n\nIt's to criminalize anything short of forced Christian reproduction rules.",

Like, as friendly as I can say, who could even listen to you if you have no means of connecting your language, in essence, your whole argument with anyone and your rhetoric falls entirely. \n\nDo you spread this as a means of feeling like a good person, because a good person might reflect on their arguments and tactics and adjust them accordingly or simply find some other ship to back.",
                    "Well im glad you don't necessarily call people baby murderers, but we are humans on this earth with earthly problems, solutions, desires, and temptation. Many many people follow the Catholic and Christian faith. However, many lived outside of this and if a faith based argument should compel them to act at all differently, shame and patronization is the last thing that could or would reach them. \n\nThe ideal of right to life and the right to choose is one that should be sympathized with, not shamed. Follow your faith. I don't fault that ever, but absolutely be better than that. They aren't cold hearted murderers, they're people seeking an answer that wouldn't see \"pray\" as a viable option.\n\nIf you are unable to connect with someone doing an action you disagree with, do not champion their shaming. That is something that forces the easiest and only action to be doubling down on their action in question. In this example abortion. \n\nIf Right to Life followed any ideology where they wanted \"to speak for the unborn child\" they would hold up other options that could be better than terminating a pregnancy, should be better than an abortion, and would work so hard to make that accessible to where it made any feasible difference. You'd have more churchgoers that way. \n\nI don't fault you for that but I absolutely fault the behavior, rhetoric, and common personalities I see in these movements. These arguments will never reach anyone and is the equivalent of drooling in someone's mouth en masse, with zero personal awareness or understanding of sociology. That movement would honestly be twice as effective and bankable if half of you all sat back and worked on yourselves first and learned how to first talk to another person."

One of her (now former) friends went off of the pill before her boyfriend departed for the Air Force, she was leaving two weeks later. Long story short, she got pregnant *surprise suprise* and joyfully alerted everyone to the fact that she was going to the slaughterhouse. All she can talk about is what a burden it was, that she can't exercise for a certain amount of time etc. She stood in front of everyone in the group and told them how it wasn't a big deal and that she has a high pain tolerance, to which my daughter responded, \"Let's hope that you passed that onto your child, cause that saline injection basically burns the baby to death.\" They're no longer friends to say the least. The fact that they have no remorse is so f'ing disgusting you wonder if it's a coping mechanism, a low IQ, or the fact that they've been lied to their entire life...\"it's just a clump of cells\" bs.

But I'm not sure \"shame\" is the right word: I think \"conscience\" is more important. People should regret abortion (and complicity in it) interiorly because they know they did wrong, not so much because they fear what others will say and think about them.\n\nMaybe her moodiness is really deep down some guilt or regret, she just may not be admitting it yet."

For example, I'm not sure if this one is really a pro-life meme so much as a statement about opposing gun control: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProLifeMemes/comments/v1vq2e/they\\_are\\_the\\_same\\_people/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProLifeMemes/comments/v1vq2e/they_are_the_same_people/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and personally would personally like to suggest that we mght need some minor rules on these sorts of things. But at the same time I'm also aware that I could also easily do some spicy memes in a few days about the bombings of Hiroshima/Nagasaki and compare them to abortion, and what I definitely don't want to do is propose a rule  that is either biased against the views I disagree with (except pro-choicers on this space, because it's not their sub, [r/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igWazH_Babw)[AntiLifeMemes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igWazH_Babw) this is not), and obviously, the flipside of not wanting to make a rule against consistent life ethic memes (which I'd like to see more of) is that it would be totally unfair to make one that was biased against conservatives, which is the absolute last thing I'd want the sub to do, and to be clear isn't my proposal.",
                    ">Would it be possible to add a link to a bunch of meme templates in the sidebar?\n\nDone.  It's in a dropdown called Templates at top of sub.\n\nEdit: on reddit mobile, I found it in the Menu at top of sub (after About)\n\n>And also, any chance we could make a rule that all posts have to be pro-life memes or mod approved?\n\nExcellent idea. Have some new rules posted now with this idea.\n\n>I also think it would be worth having a think about how to make rules for posts that relate to other politics as well, and if they count as off-topic.\n\nThese are some good thoughts...still looking at what we might do.  I wonder if making up a wiki page to help users navigate some of this nuance, combined with a rule about \"being in good taste\"... maybe that's too vague, but in line with what you said, we might make a meme with a strong message, and it becomes more a message about the other thing instead.  Or maybe just, \"No other politics...\" as a rule, lightly enforced."

All you need to be pro-life (i.e, correct on abortion) is just to think abortion is killing a child and something the law should prohibit.",

If you are arguing with someone and introduce an easily disproven falsifiable claim, it makes it easier for people to dismiss the arguments as unrealistic or fanciful.\n\nThere is no use in being dishonest about how hard being a parent is. It's really hard, and there are elements of it that are very unpleasant. Things like:\n\n- Getting no sleep for years  \n- Having to do literally everything to care for your kids  \n- Loss of intimacy, or at least much more difficult to maintain intimacy with your partner  \n- No privacy  \n- Increased expenses (I don't buy the numbers that people throw around, but kids do add expense)  \n- Health issues that could crop up, either with you or the kids  \n\nThings like that. It's messy being a parent. I still love my kids and would not trade them for anything. It also means that I have to solve the problems they introduce into my life.\n\nAnd regardless of what problems they introduce; they have the right to live.",

Some scientists argue that it's possible that they start to feel pain after the 1st trimester, but it still doesn't mean we should be ok with early-term abortions. A human being even at the very beginning of their life isn't equivalent to a plant, because a plant will never be able to gain consciousness. \n\nI've seen people arguing that painlessly killing an animal is morally fine, because if there's no pain and no fear, then it's \"humane\". But, honestly, if two people wanted to kill me, disagreeing only on whether it should be done while I'm asleep or not, I wouldn't see much difference between them. And I'd rather experience pain to save my life then die without pain.\n\nMost people have to agree, at least to a degree, that future capacities matter. I mean, some people who eat animals justify it by saying that human intelligence is superior. However, they'll have to add that it's still not ok to kill a newborn baby, even though they're currently only as intelligent as some non-human animals. Why? Because they'll gain the necessary level of intelligence in future.\n\nAnd while I disagree with those people on what level of intelligence should be enough to value life, valuing future abilities totally makes sence, since by killing people we deprive them of their future, not their past.",

I completely agree we need to pass the ERA, but I think we also need specific language in a law explicitly referencing the ERA and based on the ERA that legalizes abortion completely, and that avoids the unnecessary regulations that were set up to try to force clinics to close.   It should also include language that sets guidelines for \"pregnancy centers\" and for demonstrators.  There should be legal requirements for how far away from the building they must be, how loud they may be, and that they are not entitled to touch, impede, or scream at individuals entering or leaving the building, just as we do for polling places during elections.  Finally, every state should be required to continue collecting data regarding maternal mortality and morbidity.  Some states - I'm looking at you, Idaho! - stopped collecting it soon after the Dobbs decision, because they didn't want anyone to know that MM&M would increase when abortion became unavailable."

The parents we help are saints and I honestly don\u2019t know how they do it, especially since most are on government assistance. They do it because they love their children, but I can guarantee they would be much happier if their children were healthy. It is one of the most terrifying, traumatic, depressing situations you could ever be in.

I've had parents miss family  weddings, graduations, and funerals because they didn't have a nurse. Some of them haven't even left their town in years. The other children do not have their parents there for them. Don't get me wrong, these people are the best of us. They don't *have* to do this.

                    "Women must be self sacrificing. Paper from a sociologist who interviewed U.K. antis over five years .\n\n\n\nSacrifice as \u2018natural motherhood\u2019\nThe idea that motherhood should be a women\u2019s primary role in life has a long history and is linked to all areas of reproductive health (Forna, 1998; Hays, 1996; Lowe, 2016; Luker, 1984). This is manifest through maternal sacrifice; the idea that women should always put the welfare of their children before their own, whether children are already born, in utero or imagined in the future. This sacrificial stance is deemed the marker of the \u2018proper\u2019 woman (Hays, 1996; Lowe, 2016). The notion of sacrifice is used to police women\u2019s bodies and behaviour, whether they have children or not (Lowe, 2016). Maternal sacrifice has a symbolic function which can reassert traditional ideas about gendered roles at individual, community or national levels (Lowe, 2016; Page, 2016). The \u2018bad mother\u2019 who refuses to make \u2018appropriate\u2019 sacrifices is constructed as endangering her existing or future children and, more broadly, the reproduction of societies (Lowe, 2016). Moreover, mothers in marginalised positions, for example due to their social class, ethnicity, or being the \u2018wrong\u2019 age, are often positioned as \u2018bad\u2019 regardless of their mothering behaviour. The idea of maternal sacrifice materialises in abortion discourses, not least that women, regardless of the costs, should continue with a pregnancy (Ginsburg, 1989; Lowe, 2016). These ideas of \u2018natural\u2019 sacrifice are important in the anti-abortion position as \u2018proper\u2019 women should put the welfare of a developing foetus before themselves. Hence women who seek abortion are not just ending a pregnancy but constructed as failing in a central tenet of womanhood.\nIdeas about sacrificial motherhood are also religiously embedded. In 2015 Pope Francis commended mothers for their dedication and sacrifice; sacrifice was constructed as an under-recognised societal good, rather than something to be critiqued (Page, 2016). There is a historical trajectory regarding the construction of sacrificial motherhood within Christianity, centred on the symbolism of the Virgin Mary. Influential theologians such as Aquinas and Augustine traditionally accorded women a very limited role in society, premised on them having children and being subordinate to men (Furlong, 1991; Lloyd, 1993; Warner, 1978). This had a crucial influence on how femininity within Christianity was constructed; women were to be gentle, innocent and humble, following the image of the Virgin:\n[Mary\u2019s] purity and submissiveness and poverty became quintessential motherliness \u2026 she is obedient, respectful, humble, quiet, and modest, simple in her tastes and demeanour, compliant and gentle. Even her silence in the Gospels is turned to good account, becoming an example to all women to hold their tongues. (Warner, 1978: 190)\nAlthough Mary has been variously utilised to support competing formations of womanhood (e.g. Beattie, 2002), it is the notion of Mary as a sacrificial mother which is influential (Llewellyn, 2016). Within Catholicism, Mary is particularly important, and such interpretations have often disciplined motherhood, encouraging women to aspire to an impossible ideal:\nAlthough Christianity did not, on its own, invent the motherhood myth, the Church has been highly efficient at marketing the maternal ideal. Mary is held up to Catholic women everywhere as an inspirational figure. \u2026 No one has ever painted Mary going about the mundane tasks of motherhood. (Forna, 1998: 9)\nBecause sacrifice has been utilised as a disciplining tool to promote specific motherhood formations, this has also, paradoxically, enabled its devaluation, for it is a passive femininity that is being endorsed. These ideas are reflected in religious framings of the sacredness of motherhood in many anti-abortion narratives.\n\nLink https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1350506818785191",

                    "I think the most important thing is to believe your girlfriend when she tells you how she feels. Some people do struggle emotionally after an abortion, but research shows that the most common emotion abortion patients experience is actually relief. Try to be neutral when you ask her how she's feeling and accept what she tells you.\n\nIt's also okay if you're more sad about this than she is. You don't have to be having the same emotional experience. If that's the case, I would encourage you to find someone else to talk to about it instead of relying exclusively on your girlfriend to deal with your feelings.\n\nIn terms of tips, the [DIY Doula](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57f7026fb3db2bbcce92abb3/t/5811796029687f04802e8180/1477540212493/DIYDoulaZine.pdf) has a ton of great self care tips for before, during, and after an abortion. If either of you do need help recovering emotionally, you can check out the [Abortion Resolution Workbook](https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/abortion-resolution-workbook) or, if you're in the US or Canada, you can reach out to [Exhale](https://exhaleprovoice.org/) or [Connect and Breathe](https://www.connectandbreathe.org/)."

Be extremely careful when someone offers to sell you pills!** The _only_ reliable sources of abortion pills in the Philippines are [Women Help Women](https://womenhelp.org) and [Women on Web](https://womenonweb.org).\n\nIf you are in the Philippines and are using/will use abortion pills obtained from a private pill seller, read this carefully. It's important to be cautious.\n1. **Don\u2019t Trust the Seller**: The person selling you the pills may not have the right medical knowledge. They might give you incorrect or even dangerous advice. Instead, use [Safe2Choose](https://safe2choose.org) for accurate information on how to use abortion pills. Organizations like Safe2Choose, Women Help Women, and Women On Web rely on extensive medical research, unlike the seller who\u2019s only interested in making money.\n2. **Avoid Vaginal Use of Misoprostol:** It\u2019s not recommended to use misoprostol vaginally, especially in countries where abortion is illegal. You can read more about this [here](https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/985/are-there-other-ways-to-use-misoprostol).\n3. **No Special Preparations Needed:** You don\u2019t have to fast, exercise, eat specific foods, or do anything special before taking the pills. None of these actions increase the chances of a successful abortion and some may even be harmful.\n4. **You might not see the pregnancy:** The seller may tell you to look for a \u201csac\u201d (the gestational sac containing the embryo/fetus) to confirm a successful abortion. However, if you\u2019re less than 8 weeks pregnant, it\u2019s very small and hard to see. Even at 7-8 weeks, it might be mistaken for a clot or other tissue. After 10 weeks, it becomes easier to recognize. So, not seeing anything pass doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the abortion didn\u2019t work. Signs of success include bleeding, passing clots, and improvement in pregnancy symptoms, like nausea and breast tenderness.\n5. **Quick Process:** The pregnancy should pass within hours, not days, once you start bleeding.\n6. **Confirming Success:** To be sure your abortion was successful, you can get an ultrasound or have consecutive blood tests in the days following. You can also take a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the abortion.\nIn summary, be careful when using abortion pills from a private seller. Seek reliable information from reputable sources.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I had a friend who acknowledged she abused alcohol, and was super loud about doctors and the CDC suggesting pregnant people not drink because it's never safe to be \"misogynistic\". She's a nurse, drank throughout, and her kid has since been diagnosed with some sort of FASD a few years later. Remember that this diagnosis is a spectrum. A child can be diagnosed later in life. You typically only hear about the obvious infant cases. \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/index.html\n\nETA: there is *no* safe time to use alcohol in pregnancy.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/alcohol-use.html",
                    "I'm sorry. This sounds very difficult. I know the advice is to stop drinking as soon as you know you're pregnant. If you're considering continuing with the pregnancy, I would not have any additional drinks. I'm not aware of any tests or treatments available at this stage, but I personally would make an appointment with an OB/GYN as soon as possible to get an expert opinion and start prenatal care if I wanted to continue the pregnancy.",
                    "Just wanted to add here this absolutely is not your fault. How could you have known?? The rest of us out here who are sexually active and also drinking are just taking things as they come too and it could happen to SO many people. It doesn\u2019t seem like you have huge risks here at this point but absolutely worth talking to a doctor. Just wanted to add to the chorus of people reminding you this is NOT your fault",
                    "When I was pregnant I had the same concern. You should stop now. Definitely consult your doctor. My OB told me I was still early and my baby was surviving off of the embryo sac(forgot what she said) but basically that until the baby is connected to you they should be fine. Just stop now and take prenatal vitamins",
                    "The most dangerous time to drink is during the first 3 months of pregnancy. It\u2019s only the first 2 weeks after fertilization when drinking won\u2019t affect the fetus. It is connected after that time to the mom and will cause the most severe defects because the most crucial early development is being set up and any tiny imperfections will magnify in the later stages of development, like having a bad foundation on a building.",
                    "i know it\u2019s easier said than done but try your best not to worry too much! the best person to talk to will be your doctor. they can give you the most accurate answer and help you understand the risks to your baby, if any\u2026until then try not to assume the worst\u2026 i don\u2019t know any facts about FAS so im not going to comment on it but i do know a lot of people take a little while to find out their pregnant and drink/smoke/ etc regularly\u2026! don\u2019t feel guilty or judge yourself too harshly. i\u2019m sure it\u2019s more common than you think! i hope the doctor has good news and we\u2019re all here to support you no matter what!",
                    "I actually found out I was pregnant w my son after a night of drinking, I had to walk to cvs bc I was still drunk and couldn\u2019t drive \ud83d\udc80 he\u2019s perfectly healthy!",
                    "8 weeks is still very early, I think you\u2019ll be fine but you have to stop now. Your fears of fetal alcohol syndrome are real, because while there isn\u2019t a lot of info on FAS yet, why risk it? No one wants to have to terminate either, and power to you whichever choice you make but if you think you might not be able to quit, maybe termination until you are in a better place mentally is a good thing to consider.",
                    "Anecdotally: I know people who have been on hella benders and their kids are 100% fine. \n\nThis is something you'd have to have a consultation for to weigh the risks. Don't blame yourself tho! You didn't know! And that's okay not to know!",
                    "This is just my experience but I also found out at 8 weeks and had also been drinking heavily for a while prior to that. I was a weekend bartender at the time so shots on my shift with coworkers & regulars were super common. Then that would turn into going to another bar for a couple hours after mine closed and would continue to drink. Obviously I quit the day I found out and baby is now a happy and healthy 4 month old! I\u2019m 27 so close in age to you as well. \n\nFrom what I\u2019d read back then, when baby is that small it\u2019s basically impossible to cause damage. \nBest of luck to you with whatever choice you make!",
                    "Don\u2019t feel guilty, just do better moving forward! The placenta may not have grown yet, Ik at my 7 5 day appt I didn\u2019t have a placenta yet. It\u2019s not going to the baby!",

                    "\nYou chose the post flair Asia.\n\n**If you are in the Philippines, read this whole comment.**\n\nIf you are _not_ in the Philippines, add your country to your post so we can give you location-specific information.\n\n---\n\n**There are scammers active on this sub. Be extremely careful when someone offers to sell you pills!** The _only_ reliable sources of abortion pills in the Philippines are [Women Help Women](https://womenhelp.org) and [Women on Web](https://womenonweb.org).\n\nIf you are in the Philippines and are using/will use abortion pills obtained from a private pill seller, read this carefully. It's important to be cautious.\n1. **Don\u2019t Trust the Seller**: The person selling you the pills may not have the right medical knowledge. They might give you incorrect or even dangerous advice. Instead, use [Safe2Choose](https://safe2choose.org) for accurate information on how to use abortion pills. Organizations like Safe2Choose, Women Help Women, and Women On Web rely on extensive medical research, unlike the seller who\u2019s only interested in making money.\n2. **Avoid Vaginal Use of Misoprostol:** It\u2019s not recommended to use misoprostol vaginally, especially in countries where abortion is illegal. You can read more about this [here](https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/985/are-there-other-ways-to-use-misoprostol).\n3. **No Special Preparations Needed:** You don\u2019t have to fast, exercise, eat specific foods, or do anything special before taking the pills. None of these actions increase the chances of a successful abortion and some may even be harmful.\n4. **You might not see the pregnancy:** The seller may tell you to look for a \u201csac\u201d (the gestational sac containing the embryo/fetus) to confirm a successful abortion. However, if you\u2019re less than 8 weeks pregnant, it\u2019s very small and hard to see. Even at 7-8 weeks, it might be mistaken for a clot or other tissue. After 10 weeks, it becomes easier to recognize. So, not seeing anything pass doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the abortion didn\u2019t work. Signs of success include bleeding, passing clots, and improvement in pregnancy symptoms, like nausea and breast tenderness.\n5. **Quick Process:** The pregnancy should pass within hours, not days, once you start bleeding.\n6. **Confirming Success:** To be sure your abortion was successful, you can get an ultrasound or have consecutive blood tests in the days following. You can also take a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the abortion.\nIn summary, be careful when using abortion pills from a private seller. Seek reliable information from reputable sources.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                    "I'm having something like this right now, and I was wondering what this means. Like I'm supposed to be starting my period, and I'm getting something like this but not as watery. It's more like a brown goop, and it reminds me of blood clots or like balls of something. I'm just really confused about what is happening to my body, and I really would like some help. I was wondering if anyone could have a possible answer for me?",
                    "I don't have a IUD, and I take birth control pills.",
                    "This may very likely have been the cleaner! It is a lot like iodine, and a brown discharge is normal. If you reported a history of UTI's, it's even more likely they used this cleaner when inserting your IUD. I would recommend calling about any concerns you have.",
                    "It's definitely normal and yes I experienced it plus slightly different cramps after Kyleena. Generally brown discharge just means it's older, oxidized blood. Not sure why this happens so soon after IUD placement but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI went on to be just fine and I expect you will too",
                    "I just got my 2nd iud yesterday and I\u2019ve had the same thing. I think it\u2019s just older thicker endometrium. They insert a measuring device into your uterus to position the iud and pull it out and I think that stirs up and scraped out some of that thicker older uterine lining that doesn\u2019t naturally come out during your period. I had some come out during the actual insertion and doc was not concerned at all so seems normal."

Also, hold the girls up and use a hairdryer to make sure that skin is really dry.  Do all this twice a day for about a week.  If it\u2019s still not resolved after that, see a medical professional for something a bit stronger.  One last thought, wash your bras after each wear so you aren\u2019t reintroducing the yeast back to healing skin.  Good luck!",

Unfortunately insurance carriers co tract a price with providers which is typically much, much higher than private pay. That\u2019s due to the insurance, not PP. I know it doesn\u2019t help now but in the future you can contact your insurance company ahead of time and ask for a billing estimate prior to any treatment.",

                    "But what I don't understand is how they billed me so high in the first place for a service that's on their site says for testing and treatment only costs $50-96. I thought PP was supposed to be affordable / low cost. What does my insurance have to do with billing me almost $700"

                    "I've lost weight and gained muscle all on HBC.\n\nYou said you're working out with weights, you're going to gain muscle. Ignore the number on the scale. How are your clothes fitting? Are you improving in strength (like getting heavier plates/dumbbells/etc)?",
                    "My clothes fit the same, I feel a lot stronger though and have more endurance than I did a month ago. I went from not being able to do a push up to doing at least 20 no problem",
                    "If you\u2019ve been on the pill for 4 years and not experienced this until recently, it\u2019s 99% likely not the pill. Side effects happen upon starting a medication and will not appear 4 years after. \n\nThe weight gain that\u2019s often conflated with pill side effects is usually instead caused by normal hormonal changes and changes in body composition for women in their early 20s. The same happened to me. I\u2019m almost 22, and I\u2019ve been on the pill since age 16 but when I hit age 18-19, I gained a decent amount of weight and my body seemed like it was distributing itself differently. Granted, some of this was due to overeating during the pandemic. BUT most of it is natural. I\u2019ve since learned and accepted that we cannot all look the way we did as teenagers, and an adult woman in her 20s will inevitably have a different body shape and weight than her past self from 4 years ago. I don\u2019t mean to deny your concerns\u2014I certainly would attribute it to the pill if this were a new addition to your life\u2014but I think this is just a part of growing into adulthood :) be kind to yourself!\n\nThat said\u2026if you don\u2019t need/want the pill anymore, do what is best for you! I hope it is a seamless experience.",
                    "This for me was the total opposite. Side effects started after 4 years.\nWeight gain was all for the pill for me.\nEven if i was working out and dieting (with personal trainer and dietologist) nothing changed for 8 months until i finally gave up on my pill.",
                    "I think you are definitely right. And 6 months ago I was in a car accident and definitely fell out of good habits, I\u2019m just now getting back into the things I used to do to take care of myself. I\u2019ll probably still go off of the pill just to see what happens but this makes more sense than this all being a random side effect",
                    "Yes. I have been able to loose weight on Sprintec.",
                    "Maybe I\u2019m being impatient then lol",
                    "When I had the IUD I gained a LOT and didn\u2019t matter what I tried I couldn\u2019t lose weight. I counted calories, followed a healthy diet with protein and lots of vegetables and fruits, was training 5-6times a week and I was very sporty before also, I always go to work with a bycicle and at work I walk a lot (7-10km) every day. Still, I was stuck. (I had other problems with my IUD also, so) I went back to the doctor and at the end I got rid of it. I\u2019m back to the pill since March and it\u2019s a lot easier. I still have to lose some weight I gained while was with the IUD but I\u2019m already getting there.",
                    "Muscle weighs more than fat because it's denser. So depending on how much you initially weighed and how much you work out, it would make sense to weigh the same or more even if you feel fitter.",
                    "I\u2019ve been on sprintec for 8 years, I have a naturally slim build. My weight was very constant for 6 years then two years ago I began going down very slowly, I\u2019ve lost about 10lbs. Weight loss was fully unintentional and entirely because my job now is more physically demanding.",
                    "I unfortunately do not have a slim build and have been on the chubbier side since I was a toddler lol. My weight has been pretty much the same since I graduated high school though, maybe with a couple extra pounds.",
                    "If you\u2019ve not noticed it affecting your weight before then it\u2019s likely not caused by the pill.\n\nYou probably have gained weight due to muscle increase.\n\nAlso another thing to consider is with PCOS there is a big likelihood of insulin resistance that can affect weight and make weight loss harder. Insulin resistance if not addressed, can progress over time to prediabetes and then diabetes. So what I would do is have your HbA1c checked, but also fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin and based on those 2 tests you can calculate your HOMA-IR and QUICKI scores. They are algorithms that estimate the likelihood of insulin resistance. Even doctors use these, they are scientifically valid. You can find online calculators for these if you google with those abbreviations. \n\nI am saying this just because IR is so prevalent in PCOS and many people who have it struggle to lose weight. If you join the PCOS subreddit you\u2019ll see loads of people having this same problem. There are diet and lifestyle modifications, meds and supplements that help, but I won\u2019t go into all that here.",
                    "Would you get these things checked before or after going off the pill?",
                    "it may be water retention caused my sprintec. i would personally recommend getting off of it and trying to ease your symptoms holistically. meaning keep doing what your doing in terms of exercise and diet and if you plan to get pregnant one day, you\u2019d have to get off birth control one way or another. therefore, i think that as long as you stick to what your doing, and getting a blood test to see what supplements and foods you need to get to fix your hormonal ima balance (after getting offbirth control) sprintec usually increases craving as well as water retention. \nthat\u2019s the reason why i\u2019m not going on birth control w pcos but trying to do everything your doing. i started a diet, exercising, cold showers, and actually got a blood test today. i would speak to your gyno to make sure for 100%",
                    "Thanks this was pretty much my plan just wasn\u2019t sure if it was a good idea. I have 3 pills left then I\u2019m done",
                    "It might be that the dramatic weight loss fucked up your metabolism a bit, and what you\u2019re considering calorie deficit right now might just be maintenance atm.",
                    "The pill only makes you more hungry",
                    "Yeah definitely have noticed that within the last 6 months. Before that I never had an issue with appetite, now I\u2019m starving 24/7 no matter how much I eat",

I had a bartholin cyst that was there but i have been taking antibiotics to make it go away could it have popped? Or could i be pregnant? Or something else?

I\u2019ve gotten an ultrasound of my uterus done, no scarring; therefore, no signs of cysts. I produce excess hair on my chin, hormonal acne, and have issues with my weight\u2014all of this gave my doctors reason to diagnose me with PCOS; however, I think there might be some other issue going on.",

Here are a few suggestions that might help:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nNutrition: Consider incorporating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon or flaxseeds, which may help with mood regulation. Also, maintaining a balanced diet can have a positive impact on your overall well-being.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSupplements: You might want to explore supplements like vitamin B6 or magnesium, as they are known to help alleviate PMS symptoms. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplements, especially if you're breastfeeding.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSelf-Care: Prioritize self-care activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Whether it's taking a warm bath, practicing deep breathing exercises, or enjoying a hobby, carving out time for yourself can make a significant difference.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nCommunication: Openly communicate with your husband about your feelings and let him know that you're going through a challenging time. Sharing your experiences can foster understanding and support.\r  \n I hope this information is understandable and educational."

Evening primrose oil is often marketed as a supplement that may help with various health concerns due to its gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) content.Breast size is largely determined by genetics, hormonal fluctuations, and overall body composition. While some people believe that EPO could influence hormonal balance, more research is needed to establish its efficacy and safety in this regard.",

EPO contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which may influence hormone production, but its impact on breast size is inconclusive. Factors like genetics and overall health play a more significant role in breast development.\r  \nBefore considering EPO or any supplement, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. Self-medicating can have unintended consequences, and individual responses to supplements vary. Always prioritize your health and seek personalized advice from a qualified medical professional."

                    "Reproductive justice is a term (and vision for the reproductive rights movement) that was built by activist, Loretta Ross. Ross, and other WOC broadly, challenged what white American activists understood as reproductive rights. For white, cishet, often middle class women - repro rights was focused largely on a woman\u2019s right to access safe affordable birth control and abortion. \n\nImmigrant, indigenous, lesbian, and Black women and trans men often need access to those aspects of repro health, too - but those groups of people with uteruses have historically (and still) need access to their right to have and raise children in safe, sustainable circumstances. WOC have been sterilized against their will. Black women face insanely high mortality rates as do their infant children due to racist discrimination in OB medicine. \n\nThe BLM movement, like Ross\u2019s more comprehensive and intersectional understanding of repro justice, requires racial literacy in praxis. BLM fights to make clear: Black lives are socially and culturally constructed as less valuable in all aspects of American (and even Western) white supremacist societies. And as such, Black lives and experiences are often and deliberately erased - when that understanding intersects with repro justice, those of us committed to both movements must acknowledge and advocate for the very life-or-death and distinct reproductive health needs of Black people with uteruses and their children."

                    "One thing I see from the PL side fairly often that I wanted to address relates to bodily autonomy being used as a defense for abortion. I often see PLers referring to the idea that no/very few women cite bodily autonomy as the reason that they're choosing to abort. Instead, they cite things like financial reasons, career goals, relationship issues, etc. They pretty much never say \"it's because my bodily autonomy is violated\" when they're answering surveys or filling out forms. And on its surface, this can theoretically make it seem like the bodily autonomy defense falls flat. \n\nBut I'd encourage any PLers making this argument (or encountering it from others on your side) to consider that the reasons for someone not wanting a bodily autonomy invasion and the justification for said bodily autonomy invasion being wrong are not and need not be the same. It's easiest to understand if you consider another very common bodily autonomy invasion: rape. For the purposes of making this point, I'm going to oversimplify rape by considering it unwanted sex (which doesn't cover all rape).  And no, I'm not suggesting a fetus is a rapist with this argument, so let's not waste our time and go there. I'm also going to use a heteronormative framing for simplicity and clarity. \n\nThere are many reasons that any given woman might not want to have sex with any given man at any given time. Some of them will seem very serious, like if she has trauma from a prior rape, she has health issues that make sex painful or dangerous, she doesn't want to risk an unplanned pregnancy, or she's saving her virginity for her religion. Some may seem more frivolous, like she doesn't want to mess up her hair for an upcoming event, or she's in the middle of watching a very good TikTok, or he said something that reminded her of SpongeBob and now she has the ick. \n\nBut when it comes to sex, we (hopefully) all understand that her reason doesn't matter. If she doesn't want to have sex for *any* reason, and he does it anyhow, then it's rape, and it's wrong. It's just as wrong if she doesn't want sex because she'd rather not be all sweaty right now since she was planning to take a super cute selfie as it would be if she doesn't want sex because her partner is abusive and she's repulsed by his touch. If he has sex with her in either case it's rape. And rape is wrong because of the bodily autonomy violation. \n\nThe same logic applies when considering unwanted pregnancies. It doesn't matter why the woman doesn't want to be pregnant. If she's forced to carry her pregnancy to term, it violates her bodily autonomy regardless. \n\nAnd maybe you feel that the bodily autonomy violation in pregnancy is justified, but consider that that's a separate argument. Her bodily autonomy is violated the same no matter what.",
                    "I've had to make this point repeatedly as well. \n\nThe reason you do something is separate from your right to do it.",
                    "Plus, women are *used* to having to give reasons beyond \"I don't want to (BA)\". \n\nYou can't just say, \"No I don't want sex,\" to your partner; you need to be sick or tired or angry.\n\nYou can't just say, \"No I don't want to go out with you,\" to an acquaintance; you need to be in a relationship, be too busy, or not interested in dating rn.\n\nWe all know what happens when women just say \"no\". We've been socially conditioned to either say \"yes\" or say \"no\" without saying actually it, because otherwise we fucking die! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
                    "I appreciate you saying this, because I do think I've had some debates on here where we were talking past each other for this reason. If I can make a similar \"appeal\" from the PL side:\n\nI don't think I (and I assume many other PLers) was ever arguing that any given reason would be a \"bad\" or \"good\" reason for an individual person to make an individual choice that is actually hers to make (such as sex, as you brought up, or pregnancy, according to the PC worldview). But I have often found myself wanting (and probably failing, in the moment) to say with clarity: These motivations for individual abortions, while weighty and deserving of attention, are not sufficient to justify legalizing killing persons. They rely on stronger reasoning (bodily autonomy and/or \"not a person\" arguments) to justify legalizing the killing. So if that stronger reasoning *does* justify legalizing it, they're unnecessary (you should be able to get an abortion for any reason whatsoever). If that stronger reasoning *does not* justify legalizing it, they're insufficient (we don't kill toddlers for those kinds of reasons). So either way, those individual motivations don't help answer the central question, \"should abortion be legal?\" even if they are relevant for other reasons. So I think they often feel like a frustrating divergence from the heart of the disagreement, or rarely, even a bad-faith deflection from it.",

It would not be an artificial intelligence, it would be a conscious entity. For it to be a moral patient, we would need to have reasonable motivation to consider that the consciousness is not merely procedural and then victim to a Chinese Room problem. If this condition is reached, and if the entity in question has non trivial self identification, in that it can distinguish itself as \u201cI\u201d, then it would be beyond doubt that it is a moral entity!\n\nHowever\u2026. There is always the Philip K Dick question that always plagues my mind about these things.

If the entity behaved exactly as what one would expect of a conscious being to behave, does it really matter if it is virtual or real? Is being virtual any less real? Every time I believe I\u2019ve come to grips with this question, I always fall back into doubt."

You're a time traveler, and you can save 1 infant in your own time, or 5 infants 100 years in the future. Who do you save?",
                    "It would have to be the infant for me.\n\nThis is due simply to the complications of pregnancy. Because of the pregnancy's complicated nature, it's not a given that the blastocysts will continue to develop.\n\nHowever, with the infant, we've seen that it has already surpassed the complications of pregnancy and now is entirely dependent on the more reliable care of the adults around it.\n\nFor this reason, due to the complications of pregnancy, the infant would be a more reliable scenario.",

But because SUBJECTIVELY given the situation I value her more than others. \n\nSo yeah, the kid is a no brainer because there is suffering to be experienced and many PLer would say that sub 20 weeks there is no sentience. You bring the age of the blastocysts up and the quality of life for the living child down, then my subjective opinion will change.",
                    "So essentially this is the burning IVF clinic scenario repackaged. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, it\u2019s a relatively well known hypothetical where an IVF clinic is burning, and similar to this one, you have to choose whether to save a baby trapped inside or some multiple numbers of embryos.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this thought experiment. First, whenever you\u2019re forcing a binary like this, it only tells you about what the respondent personally values more, and does not indicate that the respondent ascribes no value to the other choice. It\u2019s perfectly possible that someone could choose to save the infant while also sincerely believing the embryos have equivalent moral status. \n\nYou may say, how can the respondent think they have equivalent moral status if they will save only one baby vs. five? That\u2019s because the second problem is that this analogy is designed to provoke an emotional response, rather than a logical one. You can change this in lots of different ways and get different answers. For example, if it\u2019s my one child vs. 5, 10, or 100 strangers I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m choosing my child every time, easily. This is because I have an emotional attachment to my child. Someone with a more objective would probably choose to save the group with multiple people over my child. So all we can really learn from this is that we are more emotionally attached to infants than blastocysts. They\u2019re visibly much closer to looking like us. We see cute babies in the arms of their loving parents all the time. We never see blastocysts, and they\u2019re not particularly cute. But if we\u2019re to do a logical assessment of why we value the life of a newborn, many if not all of those reasons apply to blastocysts. We need to rise above emotional instinctual responses like the one this hypothetical is attempting to elicit, and instead apply reason",

                    "what\u2019s the next response if someone like myself bites the bullet and has the intuition we should save the 5 blastocysts?",
                    "Just an observation:\n\nIf something is one's actual moral \"intuition\", you wouldn't call that response \"biting the bullet.\"  A moral \"intuition\" is a strong, immediate belief about a moral situation that comes to a person without thinking about it logically. \"Biting the bullet\" is resolving to accept something unpleasant, or that you have been hesitating over. \n\nIn a moral discussion, you usually refer to *rejecting* a moral intuition as \"biting the bullet.\" It seems oddly contradictory to me that you would say \"My moral intuition is that I should save the 5 blastocysts,\" and then call that position \"biting the bullet.\" If your moral \"intuition\" was that saving the 5 blastocysts was the right thing to do, but you then applied some reasoning to the situation and decided that your moral \"intuition\" was inconsistent, you would *then* be \"biting the bullet\" by accepting the wrongness of your intuitive position and concluding that you should save the born infant.\n\nThe opposite position would be that your moral \"intuition\" was to save the infant, but you then \"bite the bullet\" to conclude that the morally consistent position was to save the blastocysts.",

                    "I've been banned for the last seven days, so it's not that I have been \"suspiciously quiet\" but rather that I have been basically censored.  Here are my answers to your questions: \n\n>1) Do you think she should\u2019ve been allowed an abortion in her home state of Texas in this case?\n\nBottom line: No, I don't think she qualifies for the maternal health exception under the law.\n\nI do think this is a particularly fraught case.  From a moral perspective, my view is that if the fetus is certain to die during pregnancy or soon thereafter, then I think abortion is tragic but acceptable in that situation.  But here, the fetus is *likely* but not *certain* to die, making this case especially difficult.  \n\nFrom a legal perspective, the case centers not on the fetus' likelihood of survival but the woman's eligibility for the maternal health exception.  As a general matter I think these exceptions should be construed narrowly so that they do not effectively become loopholes.  She seems to be basing her eligibility on potential impacts to her future fertility or potential pregnancy complications, but these harms are in my view pretty speculative.  Further, many of the potential pregnancy complications highlighted in her complaint, like gestational diabetes, are not that unusual, and don't seem to rise to the level of a \"life-threatening physical condition,\" which is what the law requires.  The state Supreme Court, which sided with the AG, noted in its ruling that the woman's doctor *did not even assert* that she has a life-threatening physical condition. Frankly, this was rookie lawyering.  (I am a lawyer.)\n\n>2) Do you think the Texas AG acted in a way that was harmful to Ms Cox or do you agree with him and his threats?\n\nI did not follow the play-by-play of press conferences and Twitter posts, but big picture: The Attorney General's duty is to faithfully enforce the law.  If he believes she does not qualify for the exception then he should enforce the law and prevent her from getting an abortion.  Further, if he believes a trial court reached an incorrect interpretation of the law, he should appeal that decision to a higher court.  This is how the legal process works.  \n\n>3) Do you think she should be punished for traveling out of state for an abortion? 3a) Do you think laws should be changed so that women cannot leave states for abortions?\n\nI don't think states have the constitutional authority to criminalize or limit interstate travel. \n\n>4) What would you do if this was you? What about if it was your daughter? Would you encourage her to risk her life and fertility or would you believe her want for an abortion is justified?\n\nI have no idea how I would personally react in this situation, but it would be largely out of my hands.  At bottom, this is a legal dispute about the scope of the statutory maternal health exception.  The law has been in effect for only a short period of time and the courts have not really had the opportunity to construe the statute until now.  \n\n* * * \nBecause I answered your questions I would like to address the rest of your post, which impugns PLers en masse for supposedly not engaging to your satisfaction on this sub.   I feel that PCers on this sub do not understand what it is like to be PL on this sub.  For every one of us there are, if I had to ballpark it, at least twenty of you.  I am confident in my beliefs and my ability to defend them, but sometimes I just don't feel up to answering 20 PC replies to every comment (most of them very low-quality and many of them making identical points).

First, he threatened felony charges on the doctors rather than appeal, second he doesn't really have a positive duty to act.

Their specialist was 3 hours away, so attending weekly appointments was hugely disruptive to their lives. \n\nPart of this isn't just prolife ideology, it's the US healthcare system.\n\nIn the UK, medical bills for a tragedy like this would not exist, and it's possible to apply for financial help with a chld's funeral costs - also, if the nearest specialist was 3 hours travel away she would get her travel costs paid for. \n\nBut it also wouldn't have happened because in a situation like this, abortion would have been legally offered her at any point - up to 24 weeks for sure, and after, if foetuses were doomed/the pregnancy was causing her medical complications. If she delayed making up her mind (understandably) to a point where a specialist was needed to carry out the abortion, again, she would have got travel costs and accommodation paid to travel to the specialist.   \n\n\nThe US healthcare system is profoundly **unjust** to working class people - as the UK system was pre-NHS.  \n\nAnd not only do prolifers not show any interest in helping pregnant women where something has gone wrong - in fact, they fight harder to ensure that a woman in a dreadful situation like this *can't* get help than they do against women who just don't want to be pregnant and abort an early embryo - prolifers *also* consistently tend to vote for politicians and parties who prop up this dreadful, unjust, money-sucking healthcare system, for the profits it gives to big business at the cost of the lives of others.  \n\n\nEven so though the NHS and state support would help a family get through the financial costs of this, the human costs would still be appalling.

                    ">PLers: How is this better than an abortion?\n\nI'm going to answer this question before I read the rest of the post:\n\nFor laws to acknowledge and protect universal human rights is always better than to dehumanize and disregard disadvantaged and marginalized people.\n\n>Miranda was told early in her pregnancy that neither twin would survive long after birth.\n\nIf you can't reasonably believe that killing a person will save someone's life, you can't kill that person. How would killing her twin babies have saved anyone's life?\n\n>So, PLers, my question is, how was this better than an abortion?\n\nIt's better to protect the right to life of these twins than to let them be killed because the former is to disregard their human rights, which constitutes dehumanization. The latter is to acknowledge their human rights, specifically their right to life.\n\nThe latter is better than the former because the very purpose of the law is to protect the rights of those within its jurisdiction. Were these twins allowed to be killed, the law would be failing.\n\n>Being unable to breathe is not a peaceful experience\n\nTrue. That this manner of death was expected for the babies doesn't take away their right to life.\n\n>And we don't know how long it will take them to financially recover, or if they ever will.\n\nIt was once argued that slavery was necessary for farmers who didn't want to experience financial suffering. It turns out that finances don't take away other peoples' rights. No amount of financial suffering justifies owning slaves or killing babies.\n\n>Pregnant patients back then would have done anything for ultrasounds and abortions, to prevent the birth of newborns whose bodies never had a chance. It's insane that we have that now, and we're not allowed to benefit from it.\n\nIf we're not allowed to benefit from modern medical technology, then how do you think we shrunk the maternal mortality rate to 0.02%? Before we had this technology, it was more like 10%, and still is in places without this technology. Do you seriously think that all of pregnancy-related technology, technique, and medicine is about killing babies?",
                    ">It's better to protect the right to life of these twins than to let them be killed because the former is to disregard their human rights, which constitutes dehumanization.\n\nThe parents of terminal childhood cancer patients are often given the option to let their children go peacefully rather than fighting.

Are you alleging that we don't see them as human beings?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If we're not allowed to benefit from modern medical technology, then how do you think we shrunk the maternal mortality rate to 0.02%?\n\nThe low maternal mortality rate is partially thanks to PC policies that allow early termination of dangerous pregnancies, as shown by the ***rise*** of mortality rates in the USA in the past 3 years mirroring the rise of PL laws. There are even some PL states who have partially de-funded or completely shut down the committees responsible for keeping track of and investigating their state's mortality rates, which means republicans understand that the numbers are connected and are okay with the correlation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as the rest of your response goes, I'd like you to answer a question for me. If you were told that you would absolutely die in 2 months, and you could either do so peacefully in your sleep, or through suffocation while you're awake, which would you choose? \n\n*You are literally justifying putting newborns through torture just to enforce your ideals.* I can't understand how you think you're the humane one here. There IS a way to double-down on fetuses being \"full human beings with rights\" without insisting that we torture them to death via a live birth they can't possibly survive.",
                    ">True. That this manner of death was expected for the babies doesn't take away their right to life.\n\nWould it be accurate to say then that you prioritize *quantity* of life over *quality* of life?",
                    "By protecting the universal human right for the fetus you directly dehumanize, disregard, a set of marginalized and disadvantaged actual women who are people, here and now that are a guaranteed PERSON with those universal human rights. \n\n>If you can't reasonably believe that killing a person will save someone's life, you can't kill that person. How would killing her twin babies have saved anyone's life?\n\nIt would have saved suffering from not only her and her family from not having to go through such a traumatic event, but also the now born babies who just suffered until death. There is a much more humane way of dying instead of suffering and that would be an abortion, if by logic the woman is sedated for an abortion then wouldn't the fetus also be, since they get everything the woman does? Now why wouldn't that be a humane way of dying instead of gasping for air? Dying before you can actually breath on your own or have tubes shoved your throat to to still suffer gasping for air? \n\n>The latter is better than the former because the very purpose of the law is to protect the rights of those within its jurisdiction.\n\nBut you aren't willing to protect the women's and what she can endure or even the entire families over the babies that will die once that hit birth? \n\n>It's better to protect the right to life of these twins than to let them be killed because the former is to disregard their human rights, which constitutes dehumanization.\n\nHow is dying humanely dehumanizing? \n\nDoes the woman and her family not count\n\n>Were these twins allowed to be killed, the law would be failing.\n\n\nI apparently disagree."

I get it \u2026 but it really boggles my mind that there are people who are just fine debating how this woman isn\u2019t sick enough for the abortion. These aren\u2019t her medical providers, they aren\u2019t even medical providers (the vast majority), they\u2019ve just \u201cread\u201d something. They aren\u2019t her spiritual advisers, her family, or her husband, and yet they want to punish her for not being willing to jeopardize her life  and health for an fetus that will most likely died before it\u2019s born and will suffer a slow torturous death after. If that is writers\u2019 moral code, fine. But that isn\u2019t this woman\u2019s. \n\nOne of my friends had to early deliver a fetus not compatible with life. She was right at 20 weeks. The hell she went through\u2026 I cannot describe it.  And in the midst of this tragedy, the kind that is some of the worst moments of their lives, the state comes in and dictates how to handle it. \n\nHow would they like if the state came in and said, sorry you can\u2019t let grandma go, she\u2019s got to suffer until nature takes her.\n\nDo PL understand that for many of us, there are fates worse than death and living that is no life.\n\nMy mother has CP. her entire life has been devoted to the disabled. She is 100% prochoice. It isn\u2019t about being ableist - it\u2019s about recognizing that there are lives worse than death and that we live in a deeply unhelpful and cold country.",

It shouldn't have been, but it has. Two women facing the devastating pain (physical and emotional) of losing a wanted pregnancy through no fault of their own, and the PL movement wants them imprisoned for it. Wants to compound and extend their grief. And it won't help the fetuses. It never would have. It just serves to hurt and punish the women.\n\nAnd I've seen them try to justify it. In this case, there are tons of PLers who are minimizing or ignoring the risks to Kate's life and her health (or making very ignorant statements because they don't have a medical background, such as that she could do a VBAC since they know someone else who did). They also minimize the severity of the syndrome affecting her fetus, which means it has a 95% likelihood of dying in utero before term (so it isn't just disabled or imperfect, as I see repeatedly claimed). And with Brittany they were mostly revealing their ignorance of miscarriages or making unfounded accusations about Brittany's character and behavior (often clearly rooted in racism and/or misogyny). \n\nBasically they have to twist themselves in knots, lie, and exaggerate, and they still can't really defend the idea that these women belong in prison or that imprisoning them helps any babies at all\n\nIt's unspeakably cruel.",

In Oct 2021 I got Covid vaccinated  and my mood has been way out of whack.  My periods have been the same, and regular but I get like 2 weeks of severe depression, anxiety, constant crying for no reason on top of the migraines I had previously. I think the vaccine is interrupting the effectiveness/hormones of the IUD and planned on getting it removed to see if it will help regulate my system.  After reading about what to expect with removal of a hormonal IUD, I'm now concerned about a hormone crash and if maybe my iud migrated which is causing these issues; maybe it just happened to be around vaccination time.  I know vaccines alter the flow (because of stressing about  covid BS) but has the vaccination weirdly affected just the mood?  Have you had IUD migration without obvious pain of perforation?  I did have a gyno appointment for removal but it was canceled twice from docs being sick. \n\nHonestly I could care less about Covid and besides IUD symptoms I have actually had the best 2 years of my life.

That's not even counting any prescription costs, copays and deductibles or any other types of visit copays.  \n\nTo top it off, it's a Cigna HMO, which means the patient doesn't have the option to go to their own providers.

My annual cost, including premiums and OOP max could be up to about $10,145, or approximately $4000 less than you are paying. That $4000 savings on my part is the benefit of getting insurance through an employer. But, behind the scenes, my employer is paying an additional $13,800 towards my premiums. [Obviously this is the worst-case scenario, and if one does not reach the OOP max than the costs would be less]\n\nOur employer-based health care financing system pushes a considerable cost of health insurance onto the backs of employers. I believe this began as a way for employers to attract employees back in olden days, but it has become a financial burden that weighs down companies with extra costs that must be passed on to customers. Plus it punishes persons who cannot get health insurance through an employer - it creates 'classes' of persons (those who have company subsidized policies, those who must shoulder the whole burden themselves, and low income persons who get government subsidies). \n\nThe obvious solution to this is to treat every citizen the same and arrange for some sort of universal health insurance scheme that we all pay for in some equitable way -- but apparently a majority of voters see this as 'socialism' because richer persons would inevitably end up subsidizing poorer persons, unless the 'quality' of medical care varied with one's payments into the system. \n\ntl;dr  yes we are screwed."

There has been a loud \"choose better!\" From men for a while, and for a growing number of women that means not choosing any of them and being comfortable with themselves. \n\nAgain, instead of choosing self love and actual self improvement men are retaliating by trying to bring women down and getting toxic. \n\nIt's a global shift as well, notice that most places birthrates are dropping not just the US and not just \"deVElOped\" nations.

It angers them that women are getting their own voice and denying them sex.

I've seen posts in other subs warning women that just because a man will fuck you doesn't mean he'll marry or want a relationship with you as if we didn't already know that. They cry and moan that women's standards are too \"unrealistic\" or that \"so many women think that they're 8s when they're really only a 5\". My personal favorite is when they cry about how \"modern feminism has just ruined the dating market\" as though they would've been staunch feminists 50 or 100 years ago. These guys would have screamed about feminists wanting \"special treatment\" for demanding the right to vote before 1920 if they'd been alive back then. \n\nIt's nothing but projection and concern trolling all the way down and, yes, I think this mindset is increasing among men.",

Porn hermione - no\u2026 \n\nI have to say it\u2019s the YT algorithms and the propaganda of the far right combined with age.\n\nI bought my Dad his first iPad after his divorce so he could have \u201ca computer\u201d and introduced him to Facebook etc and then signed him up for some Bernie Sanders groups bc we actually both were Bernie and Elizabeth Warren fans at one point - and when the Russian trolls started pounding Bernie groups with misogynistic Hillary stuff - my Dad got totally sucked into it and it got him into all the red pill narratives.   \n\nHere is an interesting take though - bc it was hard to be connected to a man with poor impulse control getting sucked into hate.\n\nI read this book - The Five Invitations - how death can teach us to live life fully written by the Director of the San Francisco Zen hospice Center and one thing that really struck me was his noticing that many people in hospice had a tendency to ruminate on the question of whether they had loved and been loved well and in general spend time thinking of people they have been in relationships with. The way I almost think of it is that it\u2019s like the last essay question on the test of life.   \n\nAnd this jives with conversations I had with my dad about whether I had been in love, and whether he thought my mom and loved him, (they got divorced).\n\nAnd so what I came to start thinking was that the right is really pushing this narrative about love, and not being loved that is particularly interesting for men who are thinking they didn\u2019t get the love that they thought they were entitled to.   Like love was a contract - and you got a woman off the shelf and married them and that meant you get a servant, you get kids, you get someone to take care of you when you\u2019re old, you get sex, you get everything.  \n\nAnd if you are an old dude without a woman - then maybe life screwed you somehow and then you are looking to blame someone for that\n\nAlso porn is not love but it makes you think of people whom you loved and compare and then argue with your long ago girlfriends, wife, secretary, coworker you harassed in your head instead of being present in the now.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to acknowledge a daughter in the now arguing for dignity and respect bc it might mean then having to be accountable to all those women who ever asked for dignity in the past and times when you might have made mistakes and have regrets about it.\n\nIt\u2019s yucky but old age is a time when people can have a lot of energy and motive to find narratives that make themselves feel good enough to escape regret instead of the courage to learn and unlearn.",

Then they grow up, and realise the world enables this/doesn\u2019t call it out or find it weird, so they never have to challenge their worldview. \n\nI\u2019m still young, but I\u2019m very much coming to terms with the fact that if I want to be a parent, I may have to be prepared to do so independently.

It's why they largely don't do anywhere near as much work to care for the child and the household as the woman does even when they were the ones who wanted to have the kid, why they're a lot less interested and often unsympathetic during pregnancy and labor, why they refer to looking after their own child as \"babysitting\" and doing a minor percentage of the baseline necessary work as \"helping her\" instead of doing their job as the parent.

Also what their expectations on their own fatherhood should look like.\n\nLots of men have unresolved issues, they love the idea of creating a family, but once reality starts to kick in, so does doubt, fear and knowledge of the practicalities. \n\nIf a partner is showing no positive reaction to pregnancy I would encourage them to seek therapy or talk about their thoughts with emotionally stable and mature adults they trust, friends or family or ideally you.\n\nPregnant women deserve support and to be able to share their excitement .",

                    "\n\n\n[Against Our Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Our_Will) is a book published in 1975 extensively detailing the history of rape. It's a rough read.\n\n>Brownmiller criticizes authors such as Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels for what she considers their oversights on the subject of rape. She defines rape as \"a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear\". She writes that, to her knowledge, no zoologist has ever observed that animals rape in their natural habitat.[2] Brownmiller sought to examine general belief systems that women who were raped deserved it, as discussed by Clinton Duffy and others. She discusses rape in war, challenges the Freudian concept of women's rape fantasies, and compares it to the gang lynchings of African Americans by white men.[3] This comparison was used to show how lynching was once considered acceptable by communities, and then attitudes changed, followed by changed laws; Brownmiller hoped the same would happen with rape.[4]",

Like does bringing up the threat of men upon women on media and in politics result in even further mental opppression of women? Genuinely curious what ways it's used intnetionally as a tool. Not disagreeing, just plainly curious.\n\nAnd yess... the shitty portion of guys who ruin things for everyone else people. Ruin things immensely and especially for women, and by proxy, and sometimes directly for men as well. Like the nadir-fallacy explains.. the bad actions of the few, often results in the misperception that the majority in that same group are alike. It's why incels exist, why most extremists exist. A few bad instances with a group can stoke someones flame so much that they will make it their life's purpose to wake up this injustice and shout to the world how (insert group) are so effed up. \n\nI would love if in the future, with things like Neuralink, we can perfectly predict if a guy is gonna end up being that couple percent type of guy who enact the worst possible violent and s\\*xual offenses on Earth, and we collectively battle royale them on an Island and the non-violent folks can grab some popcorn and enjoy the free entertainment and burn those who didn't sirvive to generate electricity to fuel further innovation until we become a Kardashev Type 1 civilization!",

                    "***Feminism is for Everybody*** **by bell hooks** comes to mind. \n\nIt's geared towards people new to feminism, it's relatively short, and it addresses a lot of misconceptions of feminism as well as the common pitfalls of feminist practice. The downside is that it's very much hooks' opinions rather than the best introduction to feminist theory. There are quite a few radical feminists who think this is among her worst work, that she's too moderate and conformist. Many think that she became too much of a hippie in her later career. \n\n***The Will to Change*** **by bell hooks** might be better, although it's longer and a bit headier. \n\nBell hooks speaks about men and masculinity in particular and how misogyny hurts men and women alike. Again, this book is a bit controversial among feminist theorists because it calls for increased empathy and other compassion to be given to men in order to further feminism as a whole. Your brothers might find it a bit eye-rolling in its optimism but I know a lot of men who've found it helpful in forming their masculinity, even if hooks is a bit of a hippie. \n\n\n***Adam's Return*** **by Fr. Richard Rohr** isn't feminist theory, but I'd still recommend it for your brothers. \n\nSpeaking of hippies, Rohr is a controversial Franciscan priest because his worldview flirts with a lot of New Age beliefs and folkways. This book is geared towards men and those who're trying to understand their masculinity. It's not feminist and outright states that it's not a feminist text but it offers a scaffolding for embracing masculinity without compromising one's conscience. It's well-loved outside of Catholicism and Christianity since it speaks of broader universal cultural archetypes.",

In most cases,  the reserve years count toward retirement but the actual retirement pay is based off of the last 3 years in (when he could go back to AD). Just an idea.",

And even if they do, it wouldn\u2019t automatically be the same rank or job. Honestly these two just need to have the kids now and put them in base daycare and then school once he retires. It\u2019s the best outcome for the whole family.",
                    "Reserve years do not count the same as AD years. He would still be able to retire at 20, but the income would be different and retirement pay does not start until age 60ish in the reserve retirement system. If he retires in his 30s or 40s, it could be a long time before he starts receiving retirement pay. Not saying this isn't a good idea, just to investigate how it may alter the retirement. He may still be able to get an AD retirement after serving reserve time, but will probably have to serve longer than what is being suggested in some of the other posts. 1 year of reserve time equals 1 year of AD for time served towards retirement,  but it takes several reserve years to equal 1 AD years in regards to pay. I'm not an expert and I have been out of the service for a while.

                    "That will have a huge negative impact on retirement. In order to collect retirement immediately, he needs to retire on active duty with 7200 points and 20 years. Switching to and retiring in the reserves, even on AD, at 20 years will mean waiting until the age of 60 to collect retirement. If he goes back to AD and stays in longer than 20 years to accumulate 7200 pts he can get immediate collection, but that extends actual retirement by 5+ years depending on how long he's in the reserves. Also, the high 3 is based on base pay for the rank, not actual earnings in a year, so that part doesn't matter as much.",

Unless they have freakishly good genes and are fit like 60 year olds, but even then it's easy to assume and end up in conflict about childcare. Certainly discuss it properly with them before kids.",
                    "Yeah, it\u2019s a bad idea for 80 year olds to be the childcare. I\u2019d worry about them falling with a new born, hearing the baby cry, being able to drive in an emergency, etc. My mom is 70 and there is no way I\u2019d leave her with a baby. She\u2019d take more naps than them.",

                    "Not to mention that this is not a short term job. \n\nGrandparents that are now 80+ today will be 90++ by the time the father is ready to start pretending to be a SAHD ( 80 +  now, plus 9 years to retirement; or a year or 2 to create the children, & then a minimum of 6 years to get them to school age, which we all know is not where the need for child care ends). \n\n....  no matter how you slice it, his plan ends up with the care-givers having a high probability of being dead before their services are no longer needed. \n\nHe does not seem to be very good at planning future events. I would bet he assumes that she will just pick up the difference if/when push comes to shove.\n\nSince he is not willing to do the job, and his 'grandparent plan'  /s is not one that can be relied upon, OP needs to clarify NOW what will be acceptable alternate plans (i.e. day care, etc) so that she does not get ambushed later.",
                    "I second this -- Not to mention today's waitlists for good child development centers are **long**. From infant care to before/after school care, you can be waiting for weeks or months, depending on the area. If something happens to the 80+ grandparents and there's no one else to pitch in, you're left scrambling for *any* childcare. My own mother, in her 60's, had a hard time with my sister's kiddo who had behavior/development issues around toddlerhood. There are things you can't plan for, and challenges that arise, and not everyone in your family is equipped to handle them. That's OK! I encourage parents to find out what makes them feel comfortable, mitigates the most risk, and is best for the kiddos.\n\nThere are comments later down the thread that mention going into reserves while kids are younger, then going back to AD once all kiddos start school (1st grade and up). If he can go back to AD, he can finish out 3 years for his pension because it sounds like a 3-year lookback period.",

I don't really blame her, her life is her own (although I wish she had been honest), but people are their own people and they unfortunately don't always do what they say. You need to have a backup plan in case you don't have free child care - that's a LOT to ask of anyone, even if they promise you it's no trouble. Any number of things could happen.",
                    "It's really unfair to ask them. It's too much for people in their 80s.",
                    "Yup, my wife also comes from a culture where \"family helps family\" and her parents who are nearby try to be helpful but they're in their late 70s and they just don't have the energy.\n\nIt's great since we don't rely on them so whenever they come to play with our kid, he loves it and it's nice but they just can't be the primary care giver.",
                    "SAHM here. I find it hilarious that he's been saying he wants to become a SAHD when his kids would be in school already. They're gone all day!! That's hardly being a SAHP, that's the easiest time to do it. That's the time when SAHPs usually go back to work. It's those first few years that really matter though. \n\nAlso I'd really go with a daycare over the grandparents. 80s is just way too old. It's not really safe for them to solo watch your baby/toddler full time at that age. They may have trouble lifting them, get back injuries, they wouldn't be able to keep up with a toddler (mine almost darted in the road and luckily I was fast enough to pull her back by her coat so she didn't get hit by a car, but an old person is not going to have those necessary life saving reflexes). Also old people just aren't aware of new safety measures and I constantly read on parenting subs about their parents putting blankets and stuffed animals in the crib which isn't safe and feeding baby unsafe things. Daycare would be a lot better for your kid, trust me. \n\nSo it's either you put your career on hold for a few years to be a SAHM. He quits early to be a SAHD. Or daycare. Daycare really isn't all that bad, don't dismiss it immediately.",

I wonder if the talk of letting his wife have the career is genuine progressive selflessness, or because he can't see himself succeeding outside the vocation he's done since he was a teenager.\n\nGiven that this dude hasn't even accounted for who's going to look after the kids in the first several years, can we realistically expect him to put the baby down and feed them periodically throughout the night by himself? After all, his working wife needs to be rested for work.\n\nIs this the sort of person that'll have lunches packed and a home-cooked meal waiting for dinner every day? Is he going to clean every day, sweep and mop weekly, and keep the yard in a clean state? Will he have all the household affairs done, so mom doesn't have anything to worry about except self-care when she gets home?\n\nDude may turn out to be an amazing dad whether he does the SAHP thing or not, but I suspect both parents may need to adjust their expectations.",
                    "Sounds like a productive conversation! Definitely talk with the grandparents sooner rather than later about what they can realistically contribute. Having grown up more like you (everyone for themselves and grandparents are not available for childcare because that\u2019s not their job according to them) I would have the same hesitance. However, if that\u2019s something they are eager to do and physically able to do, it could be a great solution for both of you to continue your careers!!

It does mean that weekends will no longer be restful but will instead tire you because you're there for the child. It does mean that you have to come back home a bit earlier and then finish some of the work at night after. So it's tough for sure but having children doesn't mean that you have to give up on your career.\n\nThere's plenty of research that shows that contrary to expectations daycare and nanny don't have much of a negative effect on infant-mother attachment security.",

I honestly think it helped him immensely with a lot of things that as a new and single parent I had no idea how to cover, from helping me with potty training to literacy skills. Plus since your spouse is military, DoD (or DHS depending on his service) will cover some of the costs so it\u2019s more affordable. Please do not shoot that idea down as it will also allow you both to keep your careers and you can still have bonding and learning after work hours.",

I'm guessing army or air force because it seems like he thinks he'd be able to count on his (his grandparents, really?) grandparents for a longer period of time, so that means not moving. \n\nMy recommendations are for him to go to the CDC on base and find out what the infant wait list is like - they were painfully long when I was in and when my younger sailors needed cold care. It's not a big deal, though, because if they're full up they give you a certificate of non availability and you can take it to a child care facility out in town that will take the CDC's subsidy. Sign up for a Budgeting for Baby class (that's what it was called in the Navy, run by Navy Marine Corps Relief Society). They give you stuff for your baby, to include an Exchange gift card and a quilt or knit blanket (again at the Navy one) and you get a 2 day class which you may already be knowledgeable about, but you might also learn a thing or two.\n\nMy wonderful wife had our son after I was 13 years in and was in a non deployable status and it made for the best 3 years in my career, but I was absolutely non deployable. My daughter came after I transferred and was then deployable and I was miserable that I missed it & lapsed into pretty bad depression, so keep deployability in mind, especially since army & AF deployments are stupid long. \n\nGL! Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen all make it work with career families, so I have no doubt you can too, just be aware of the resources you have available to you.

It does not require giving up a career, even if that often comes with the territory.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s unlikely that someone with older kids is going to actually have their kids as their primary day to day focus. It could be the case if the kid has special needs, or is home schooled, or other special circumstances, or if the non-working parent is still the primary child rearer even when the breadwinner is not present, but none of those are default assumptions.\n\nI\u2019m glad it got discussed though.

                    "Wow, a very similar story over here. My husband (M44) and I (F37) have been together for 17 years, married for 12. Near the beginning of our relationship, he wanted to have kids some day, and I was 95% against it. I left a small opening for changing my mind as I got older, but I did worry about what would happen if he wanted kids and I didn't. Soon enough I realized I for sure didn't want kids. And thank goodness he went in the same direction! It was such a relief. We're childfree and happy :)",
                    "That\u2019s nice you are both on the same page! I\u2019m 33 and my husband and I had the same idea about discussing kids once in a while to see how we\u2019re feeling. I\u2019ve never wanted them and he was a maybe (I think it\u2019s way easier to be a father anyway tbh). Lately everyone around me is starting to get pregnant and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ll regret my choice. I still don\u2019t want to be a mom or have a child but it\u2019s strange that I\u2019m feeling emotional about it. I guess it\u2019s because so many others are doing it and loving on to this new phase and I can\u2019t help but think there might be something wrong with me bc I don\u2019t want that. Anyone else relate?",
                    "I am your age. My husband and I have been married since I was 25 and we both have never wanted kids. But I also felt myself swaying for the first time this year when I attended a friend's 3yo daughter's birthday party. I realized everyone had kids. I thought about all the friends I had lost because they became parents and then only wanted to hang out with other parents (including this friend of mine, because she never met me again after the party on the 1st of Jan this year...) And I felt so utterly LEFT OUT. It was like a world that I was being excluded from.\n\nIn the end, the book The Baby Decision had several thought experiments in it that really solidified my decision that I am childfree. I was thinking about kids only from a place of fear of potential regret and pressure to fit in. I highly recommend it for both you AND your husband. \n\nThe regretfulparents sub and books like Regretting Motherhood by Orna Dornath made me realize that there are many people who do not \"love\" the permanent new phase to their lives. Unfortunately, it is largely taboo to speak about regretting parenthood, which then skews parenthood to look extremely positive. \n\nGoing on to the childfree sub also made me realize I am far more likely to regret having a child than to regret not having one. There are many thought discussions there about dealing with \"regret\". And one that stood out to me was-- why will I regret something I've never had a desire to do? Eg, I would regret never owning a cat because I've always loved cats since I was a child... But I will never regret not having climbed Mount Everest because although it seems exciting and cool, its also downright terrifying to me.\n\nAnother big thing is that I would rather regret not having a child (there's always an option of adopting or fostering), than to regret having one. After starting a dive into self help books and therapy, I've realized the HUGE impact that my parents and my upbringing has on my life. Attachment theory affects our future emotional stability, and our ability to connect with others and build healthy relationships. A resentful and regretful parent is not what a child deserves. And there is unfortunately an abundance of emotionally immature parents out there. The book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents is a very interesting read.\n\nThe book The Baby Matrix also debunks a lot of insidious pronatalist conditioning in our society, including the concept on the \"biological clock\" suddenly activating ( it's all FOMO actually). So I thought that was very useful too.\n\nMy husband is planning to get a vasectomy. I stopped him initially because I said \"what if we change our minds?\". I then spent the entire year thinking about it.. And now I am confident that we won't. The good thing is that he has even less emotional drive than me for children. He doesn't even want the Kodak moments, whereas I would like the Kodak moments but I don't want any of the work required as a parent (which is utterly unrealistic). \ud83e\udd23\n\nI hope this helps!",
                    "I totally relate. I'm 33 and have never been one to dream about having kids. Whenever I think about having them, my only real reason to do it is fear of regret. Which doesn't seem like a good enough reason. I feel like it should be a hell yes, something I'm passionate and excited about. \n\nMy husband is happy either way, so where we are at is basically, if I wake up one day and have a sudden hell yes feeling, we will go for it.",
                    "Completely relate. I think about the amazing relationship I have with my (35) mom (66) and suddenly I'm sad for my future self, who won't have a kid to have an amazing relationship with. Like what if I really start to regret it at 66 when I can't do a thing about it? But so far the potential desire for a potential future relationship hasn't been enough for me to seriously want children. I do get sad sometimes when I think about it though.",
                    "Hard relate. I'm younger but I know for sure I'm not gonna have kids. I don't want kids. I love my nieces, but I don't want my own. But in a way, I sometimes feel that I'll miss out on a part of life, something I'll never experience... But my decision remains the same. It is weird though to feel emotional about it even if I'm sure.",
                    "This was similarly to the story of me and my wife. \n\nShe had wanted kids for a long time but I\u2019d always been on the fence. I liked certain ideas about fatherhood but if I never had kids, I knew I wouldn\u2019t be upset. That alone made me think it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea. Therapy solidified it but considering how long we\u2019d been together and how long she\u2019d been waiting for kids, by that point, I was willing to do it anyway\n\nBut life just never really lined up for us for kids to make sense. \n\nA couple years ago, we take our first real vacation together, a 7 day cruise. We\u2019re sitting on our balcony on day 5 or 6. Im reading a book, she\u2019s leaning on the railing and she turns to me and says \u201cMake you a deal\u2026.you take me on a cruise once a year and we can forget about kids\u201d\n\n\u201cSold!\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d started waffling on her desire for kids some months prior, largely due to where we live(Texas), our careers not being super child friendly(not impossible but not easy to be parents), not being comfortable enough financially(we do ok for ourselves but even now, things get a little dicey), and just generally how life has gone, she\u2019d started to decide against it. \n\nI got a vasectomy back in June and she\u2019s mentioned thinking about a tubal ligation so we\u2019re pretty much committed to the childfree lifestyle and being the fun aunt and uncle now",
                    "Yeah, my wife recently told me and my family that she didn\u2019t want kids.\n\nThe youngest one took it the hardest.\n\nHey-o!\n\n(Sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist.  I\u2019ll show myself out.)",

On the opposite end of this is my son. His wife was in her very early twenties when they had their first child, and the second, who came along a couple of years later. I really envy them their energy and optimism. Neither of them is a trust fund baby. They both have to work very hard to maintain any standard of living, but their devotion to their kids is clear.

If the information does coincide with the way that you're living then there's also a couple chapters on being able to get out safely.\n I wish you the best of luck and I want you to know that you deserve to be with a partner who is going to love you and cherish you and treat you as an equal versus being with someone who's gonna control you be it by how you dress or by finances or by What it is that you can do or who you can see.

I put on some weight. -that was in my head.\n\n\nOut loud, to her I replied, yes. That\u2019s what happens when you have a baby. But also? It\u2019s okay if we just *don\u2019t*  talk about my body. \n\nEvery time I see her I have to reiterate, please don\u2019t talk about my body. Please don\u2019t talk about my children\u2019s bodies. Every fucking time. \n\nIt is incredibly mentally draining to have to continually stand up for something so simple. We used to be closer, but the way she speaks has caused me to go low contact with her. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how she doesn\u2019t get it. But\u2026Some women just don\u2019t I guess.",

She embarrassed the kid in front of strangers (you), but your opinion doesn't matter. Only the opinion of thise who see the picture later. \n\nOr\n\n2. The kid possesses a trait that the mother does NOT share (like tallness), and mom would hate it in herself, so she constantly comments on it so that other people know she too does not approve. \n\nIn neither of these scenarios were the feelings of the child considered. \n\nMy mom was an abusive pos, and I look just like her. She loved herself, though, so I at least had that \"going for me\" with her. My sisters (who looked like their dads) caught flak for the physical characteristics they did not share with her. \n\nI did a lot of work to unlearn the things my mother modeled for me before having my daughter.

I\u2019m the smallest I\u2019ve ever been as an adult. I can tell how proud she is that I\u2019m smaller now. She tells me all the time how much prettier I am. It feels so good.\n\nBut she also has been finding new ways to tear me down. My boobs are too saggy. My butt is too flat.

We've really got to break the cycle. \n\n\nPeople talk a lot about young girls being insecure and the sources of it (internet, celebs, etc) but you almost never hear about all the little comments adult women (whom they love and respect the opinions of) make to them **constantly**. When I was a kid I was skinny and I was soo often told to \"enjoy it while it lasts\" and \"it will catch up with you\" and to \"just wait, you'll see it won't last forever\" by adult women like friends of my mom. No one should be saying stuff like that to a child. Children aren't even thinking and worrying about a lot of appearance things someone may make a comment about, until you say it to them and hand them a new complex to worry about.

Oh and another question. Why can't any woman (according to data and stats) sit still without anxiously bumping their foot/ankle up and down like a fucking addict 24/7? Are all of you really that high strung and anxious? Even while doing nothing? Have not found one woman under the age of 48 who does not have their phone directly in front of their nose and eyeballs forth entire duration of being out in public.

                    "OOH the glasses thing pisses me off. I had to start wearing them at age 2. When I was around 3 or 4 I realized people had \"a thing\" about glasses and resolved to not try to hide them, so I wore the brightest, most rainbow-y frames for most of middle school, then swapped to thick ray bans in high school. They actually sometimes make me look *better* (eye make-up doesn't matter nearly as much, they make your eyes look bigger, and they can hide untidy brows). I'm glad the hipsters brought them somewhat into fashion, but fuck that woman. \n\nAlso, I get that the mom is probably tired of comments about her daughter's height, but she should respond with something about like, supermodels, basketball players, or getting a free ride into the Ivy League of her choice because of her rowing *potential.* \n\nIt's bullshit people do this; it absolutely does stick with you. Thanks for sticking up for the girls. If it's not appropriate I'd maybe say something to glasses girl about how [insert hot celebrity/person she admires who wears glasses] is, and how she's a \"fashion icon\" and how so many people want glasses now, they are buying glassless frames^(wtf) \"being cool\" isn't about blending in; it's about standing out in a \"I don't care\" kinda way (in high school at least). \n\nFor the tall girl, ditto. Athlete? She's gonna kill at track/XC, soccer, and--as already mentioned--basketball and rowing. Rowing **is** a thing colleges look for, and if she starts now, she'll be recruited. If she starts in college, she should be prepared for the entire rowing team to ask if she wants to join. (I was approached after I'd already quit because they didn't recognize me from the back in a dress with my hair down, and I'm shorter than she is). Also, as a bonus, she's gonna weed out all the man babies who are \"intimidated\" by a taller woman. You do **not** want to date those.  Also, she'll never *need* to wear heels, and when she does, she's gonna turn heads more than usual. Not that that's important, but still. I'd also recommend yoga or pilates to help improve posture, because body language conveys a lot, and if she's slumping all the time (I did this because I was \"too tall\") it can push people away/make them think you're unfriendly. Head up, shoulders back, neutral to friendly expression (or hell, lean into scary bitch mode). I wish someone had told *me* that at 15. Oh and volleyball! Beach or regular. I know some girls who are professional beach players and **damn.* I think they were around her height, maybe even an inch or two over. \n\nAnd (decent) guys these days don't give a shit if you're taller than them. Biology has done her a favor. If they tell her not to wear heels--bye Felicia. (I speak from experience on that one). \n\nI hope these girls learn to find the beauty in what makes them (physically) slightly different. If you've got time to maybe slip a compliment to glasses girl and tall girl, that **always** helps **and** sticks with you. Especially if it's about the thing they were recently made to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed about. \n\nThe petty bitch in me (who resides inside my \"way too afraid to actually act on this\" teenage body) would've made a point to squint horribly and/or go cross eyed. Then I'd insist on delaying the picture to go put on contacts (as slowly as possible) and take all the time you want on eye make-up \"because I look better with it, Aunt ChicosCard said I needed to look my best\" (bonus points if she starts getting choked up at that last part). Then AuntChicosCard is going to want to sink into the floor as the whole family waits 40 minutes thanks to her stupid fucking comment. \n\nGood on you for looking out for them, sorry for the rant, I just have been there (am tall, wear glasses) and needed to vent some spleen. (Oh, and I've literally never had issues getting a boyfriend--not that that's something to brag about, and I've recently decided most aren't worth the trouble, so I greatly prefer staying home with my furballs, rather than endless dinner days, or having a guy park himself on my couch for...way too long.",

Plenty of people will tell us we're all shades of wrong for all sorts of reasons they imagine but that has little to do with our reality. I'm proud of you for making it through.

You may still be a minor, but she doesn't have to live in your body for the rest of her life and if she is abusing you (mentally or physically, with words, actions, or inaction) you should seek help. There are things that I regret not doing as a child, and they all stem from knowing that I was being abused and not screaming it from every mountain top I found until someone would help me.",

They need a 10,000$ insurance not covered surgery because of these useless fucks. Literally could have been avoided. And this fuckwad is a NURSE.)\n\nHas on more than one occasion, gotten drunk as fuck, and GRABBED MY FIANC\u00c9S ARM SO VIOLENTLY IT LEFT MARKS, and pulled them close to her and said shit like \u201cYou better believe in Jesus, you dirty little slut.\u201d\n\n\nAnywho,\n\nYour mom is a fucking out of touch, toxic bitch, who does not deserve to have children in her life at all.

Because she deserves to get that nice little visit from CPS asking why she refused her child care for something that can become SEVERE. You can always call an ambulance to come get you, and tell them on the phone \u201cI am a minor (if you are) that is being refused medical care by my parent. I need an ambulance to come pick me up because I desperately need medical care.\u201d \n\nI had to pull that card on my own parents before when they refused to get me medical care for whooping cough, and I was almost 18 at the time.

I\u2019ve had many UTIs and most of the time I get just extreme urgency and discomfort, but severe UTI\u2019s can cause other issues, like nausea, abdominal pain, lightheaded ness, and fatigue. I had a severe one a year ago, and it began manifesting as vomiting and severe stomach pain and I was sleeping so much, and we went to the hospital because I suddenly had such severe abdominal pain I thought I was having issues with my appendix or something.

The female urethra is 4-6cm from the bladder to the urinary meatus.  The male urinary meatus is in no close proximity to the rectum, the female urinary meatus on the other hand is MUCH close to the rectum.  A guy really has no chance of transferring bacteria from his rectum to his urinary meatus where it can enter the urinary tract.   Females on the other hand, with rushed or not wiping front to back, can easily transfer bacteria to the urinary tract.  Another way to say it would be that bacteria have a more accessible point of entry in female than males.",
