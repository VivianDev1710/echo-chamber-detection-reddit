These guys have a lot of resources in different countries. I have picked some other stuff below, they might appear twice, but if the resources below don't work for you or you don't live in any of the countries below, Heartbeat International will most likely have something to help you in your country.

General tip: even if you aren't religious, try calling around churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and other religious organizations. They might be able to help or direct you to resources

	comment 6: My office is next to a womens health center that offers free ultrasounds, next to that was an abortion clinic that got closed for violating various laws. He was the guy who when he died they found hundreds of dead fetuses in his garage, because serial killers keep trophies. 

They are aware of this sub so I am sure they post here.
	 comment 7: Its disgusting how history keeps repeating itself.

It seems like every few decades people choose a new group of people to dehumanize and kill
	 comment 8: To the person who asked me for a source then deleted their comment, source that my office is next door to the serial killers old office or source that he kept trophies? The later is easy to find if you search abortion doctor kept fetuses in his garage for example. [https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-abortion-doctor-fetuses-ulrich-klopfer-20191025-2nm5vfyapnhldlxi3xafepjpia-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-abortion-doctor-fetuses-ulrich-klopfer-20191025-2nm5vfyapnhldlxi3xafepjpia-story.html) I suppose I can post the photo I took of the parking lot next door that was full of police vehicles when the story broke about his trophies.

	comment 13: One of the big problems is that the large majority of Pregnancy Crisis Centers are smaller operations with only one or two locations.  

Example, There are 4 in my area (St. Petersburg FL)

One is independent with only one location

Two have four locations including St. Pete and surrounding areas. 

One has three locations in the County.

&#x200B;

There just aren't enough resources for a big operation.  However, no matter where you are in the united states you are no further than a stones throw from a Pregnancy Crisis Center that someone has poured their life into, just to be there for women in need.

	comment 19: Notice: The resources below are generally secular and US-centric unless noted otherwise. They do NOT provide or promote abortion services or abortion referrals (although some have links to entities that do, within some degrees of separation). Many of these resources are aimed at mothers, though I hope that they can also be helpful to any people looking for help.

I've organized these links into categories for convenience, but many of them are suited for multiple categories. For example, I encourage ALL pregnant and postpartum parents—not just pregnant students!—to visit the Pregnant on Campus site, which lists tons of helpful resources.

**General Resources - Essentials**  

- [211.org](http://www.211.org/) (United Way): "211 is the most comprehensive source of locally curated social services information in the U.S. and most of **Canada**. Call, text, or chat with your local 211 to speak with a community resource specialist in your area who will help you find services and resources that are available to you." - food pantries, healthcare services, housing aid, counseling, crisis hotlines, domestic violence resources, emergency shelters  

- [Benefits.gov](https://www.benefits.gov/): "Benefits.gov is an online resource to help you find federal benefits you may be eligible for in the United States." Answer a questionnaire to determine eligibility for federal benefits. Even if you don't believe that you'd qualify, it's a good idea to double-check.  

- [r/PovertyFinance **wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/wiki/index) - "Financial advice, frugality tips, stories, opportunities, and general guidance for people who are struggling financially. No Judgement, just advice!"  

- Your local public library: With a free library card, access print books, digital media, Wi-Fi, and local resources, *at no cost to you*. Find a public library **in any country** [here](https://www.worldcat.org/libraries).  

- [Aunt Bertha](https://www.auntbertha.com/): "Search for free and reduced cost services—medical care, food, job training, and more." Find nearby help based on zip code.

- [Federally Qualified
Health Centers (FQHCs)](http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/Search_HCC.aspx): "FQHCs aren't always free; instead, they charge based on your ability to pay. That said, they can be a good option, especially if you ​are in need of medical services beyond just pregnancy care. They're also the most convenient option for many women, since there are over 8,000 [U.S.] locations."

- Safe haven laws ([ChildWelfare.gov](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/safehaven.pdf#page=3&view=Protections%20for%20parents)) ([USA Today article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/09/13/safe-haven-laws-things-you-didnt-know-surrendering-newborn/2031516001/)): **All 50 U.S. states** (plus D.C. and Puerto Rico) have introduced "safe-haven laws" allowing parents to legally give up their newborn child to certain places known as "safe havens", such as fire stations, police stations, and hospitals. All states allow this at least for children 72 hours old and younger, and certain states may allow this for older babies as well. Many states require the parent to directly relinquish the baby to personnel, but some states have 100% anonymous "baby boxes". Safe Haven Baby Boxes also has a 24-hour hotline (1-866-99BABY1). Offer a window of some weeks for birth parents to reclaim their babies if they change their mind.  
- [Wikipedia: Baby hatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_hatch#International_situation) (**international**): Similar to safe haven laws. Process to safely and anonymously leave a baby in the care of the state. Generally offer a window of some weeks for birth parents to reclaim their babies if they change their mind.

They offer free pregnancy testing and ultrasound (as well as low cost STD screens). They also have parenting classes and offer resources for both prenatal care and help for expecting mothers to obtain necessary items to prepare for baby’s arrival. Absolutely wonderful organization! They helped my sister in law when she was unexpectedly pregnant at 16 years old. She wanted her baby but everyone around her was pressuring for abortion - husband and I took her here and they helped her so much. She gave birth to a gorgeous little girl ♥️

It has a list of USA organizations that help with various topics. If you go to the resources tab, you can look at local or national resources, as well as adoption information.

For the resources, you can search nearby to find organizations that can help. There are also tags that show up for the various organizations that help show the services they provide. If you click on an individual tag with a hyperlink, it pulls up other organizations that provide that service.

Some examples of tags you can search include: assistance with food, housing, shelters & temporary housing, pregnancy testing, maternity clothes and baby items, healthcare, ultrasound, prenatal and obstetric care, and more

**Financial Needs and Free Items**:

[Let Them Live](https://letthemlive.org/)

This website helps pregnant women in need by creating registries for them or raising money through online fundraisers. The amount of money raised for the different women is impressive, going up to around $30K to $40K. 

[The Heartbeat Box](https://www.theheartbeatbox.com/)

The Heartbeat Box provides boxes of baby items for moms who choose life over abortion. The box includes items such as size 1 diapers, 5 onesies (size 0-3 months), 2 zip up pajamas (size 0-3 months), newborn hats, a nasal aspirator, blankets, wipes, and more.

To get help, go to the hyperlink above and scroll down to where it says "Contact the Heartbeat Box." The email is listed as theheartbeatbox@gmail.com.

[Field of Lilies](https://www.instagram.com/field_of_lilies/)

This Instagram account helps provide free baby items for mothers. The boxes may include items such as blankets, diapers, wipes, and more.

To receive help from them, reach out to the Instagram account (field\_of\_lilies) by directly messaging the account or commenting on their posts. 

[Adoption Finder](https://adoptionmap.com/postpartum-support-program/)

Although titled Adoption Finder, this website also provides pregnancy and postpartum boxes for women. Pregnancy boxes may include things such as clothes, shoes, diapers, maternity items, etc. 

The Postpartum boxes are intended to provide items for new mothers (excluding baby items).

Go to the hyperlink above to find a sign-up application for the postpartum boxes. To get to the pregnancy boxes, you can use the hyperlink as well, but will need to navigate around the website to get to the pregnancy box section.

[Human Defense Initiative](https://humandefense.com/) (main website)

[Human Defense Initiative Resources Page Link](https://humandefense.com/help/)

They offer birthing classes, parenting classes, referrals for financial aid, housing, adoption, post abortion counseling, grief counseling, abuse counseling, amongst many other services.  They give you all the proper paperwork and documentation you need to get set up with Medicaid so you can receive all the needed medical care throughout your pregnancy.  

They will help you in any way they can.  You don’t have to go through pregnancy alone or scared without support.  ❤️❤️❤️

This ministry helps with miscarriage and stillbirth management, either at home or in the hospital. They can act as patient advocates. They also help with funeral arrangements and caskets and urns. They also have resources for the laws about these topics by  state.

This ministry also helps with funeral arrangements. But they also claim and give a dignified burial to unclaimed babies at hospitals.

If they are under served or poor and on TennCare it's even worse because so many Drs won't take TennCare or, and I have seen it first hand, they treat these woman poorly.  The Drs can be hours away and if you have no ride you have no care.  It's sad that only prenatal care is offered in ER when mother and child in crisis.  I have been told by ER Dr that OBGYN insurance is so high that providers can not afford it and I think that should be part of discussion.  Yes every life is sacred, but let's do the hard work of making sure they have great medical access and care so they can carry to term and pediatrics Drs for the babies

	comment 4: I love how highly pro-choice women think of themselves. Like, who wouldn’t betray their values to be more to attractive to someone who would murder a child we conceived in cold blood? Can’t lose a shot at such a catch, right?

Post 4: Angry beyond words
	comment 1: That’s not the only problem I have encountered with the parenting sub. Sometimes I can’t even believe some of those people have kids based on some of the replies, it seems some of them don’t really care to protect kids.
	 comment 2: Some of them? No, I see so many that are like yeah I don't really like my kids and I wished I had gotten an abortion, like what? Have we seriously lost touch with our maternal side this much??
	 comment 3: > Sometimes I can’t even believe some of those people have kids

Chances are they don't.
	comment 4: This happens on the various AITA variants constantly - pregnant woman has a story about the baby’s dad being a terrible human being, here come the suggestions to abort.  Young, poor, not in a relationship?  Doesn’t matter if it’s even relevant to the question at hand, you will be advised to abort.  And if you are having trouble with your child’s other parent, or being a young/poor/single parent who needs help, well tough luck, should have aborted.

I don’t know if it’s just Reddit or if this attitude really is representative of majority opinion, but I have never seen so many people outright unashamedly push abortion as the only right thing to do.  These people aren’t prochoice, they absolutely are pro-abortion, and anti-childbearing in a wide range of circumstances, usually for blatantly classist and eugenicist reasons.  It’s disgusting and kind of terrifying, really.
	 comment 5: I guess it comes from the mindset of what "I would do" not "what you could or should do" and the other problem is that society just seems to hate children these days. Are they acting like a normal toddler? Should've worn a condom or aborted. Want to have sex but not ready or never want kids? Get an abortion. Abortion, abortion, honestly, I'm exhausted from hearing the word for no other reason than to just brainwash everyone to make it seem normal. I've seen abortion mentioned on a Christian reddit before and I was like what the heck is happening here?? 

I'll never be a part of the majority or go with the flow, if I see injustice and I believe I can reach someone, I will speak out about it, but only in places I know I won't be downvoted to oblivion. And that's only because I don't want to lose my ability to speak to the ones who actually are struggling with the choice.
	 comment 6: It’s worse than just an unsolicited push for abortion. I’ve seen plenty of times when the mother specifically said she wants to keep the baby, and the reaction is for the pro aborts to demean her. 

Have also seen where the mother is talking about events that happened while pregnant, but the child has already been born, and the pro aborts come in saying she should have aborted. I would be furious if that was ever said to me.
	comment 7: Yeah, it's quite often I had seen those posts. If I just say something another than abortion, I'll get downvoted... No matter how much I am being polite.

It's so sad that positive encouragement is not allowed anywhere on this Reddit.
	 comment 8: I didn't bother saying anything, only rolled my eyes and shook my head. We are truly doomed if mothers will outright say if you don't want the child just kill it. It makes me sick to my stomach and I honestly could care less if I'm being downvoted for saying it.
	 comment 9: Reddit sucks in that a lot of people here will just downvote someone for disagreeing. If presented politely and in good faith then I don’t see a reason to downvote someone. I don’t often downvote people because of that.
	comment 10: If I were running a sub like that, that would be against the rules, and that rule would be enforced.
	 comment 11: Yeah, the ones that even suggest it can be blocked from the sub if they continued that crap. This is a parenting reddit, not a pro-choice reddit, go find your hive mind there and be bitter elsewhere.
	comment 12: I do see this all over but just to add a bit of positivity to this thread, my bump subreddit (specific to my due date month) has been fantastically supportive of each other even in struggles like what you’ve mentioned and I’ve really only seen one instance of anyone being pro-abortion (and it wasn’t suggesting abortion, thankfully).
	 comment 13: I absolutely love my bump as I used them for advice when I was pregnant with my little one and everyone seemed so excited to either be pregnant or have their little ones. Like it should be. So, I am glad that there is some out there that actually have a positive look in pregnancy and further on.
	comment 14: It is because not to be rude to anyone, but I have never seen a bigger gathering of purely POS’s anywhere except on Reddit (not this particular group though). The entire Reddit thing has made me lose some hope for humanity as I have met the meanest most judgmental people here that I have ever seen anywhere. The scary part is they are walking among us. Makes me not want to send my kids to public school. And this is coming from a tattooed, pierced dude who looks scary to some. But these people actually scare me. The marriage forum is “get abortion” “divorce” “men are evil” etc. of all social media Reddit is where I have seen the very worst.
	 comment 15: I'm going to be homeschooling my child(ren) because I see the corruption in the schools and the ratings for kids graduating to the next year is just pitiful. If you have a middle schooler at a fourth grade math and reading level and all the teachers do is move them up, something is VERY wrong with the system. So, my little ones will be challenged in life and not follow in the collapse of this society, with morals and ethics as their forefront. I feel for the parents who have no choice but to send their kids to public and/or private schools.
	 comment 16: I honestly think its worse in person. I come from one of the most pc countries and it's very obvious just walking around. It's just assumed that everyone is hardcore pc
	comment 17: Reddit is heavily skewed towards a demographic that tends to be very pro-abortion (young, non-religious males). I really hope that most moms would have better sense than to get an abortion based on an anonymous stranger from the internet (who could easily be a 15 year old boy who knows nothing of motherhood) suggesting it.
When I see the crazy pro-abortion comments on here, I just think that some people on Reddit just haven't matured enough to understand what is lost from an abortion, or how parenthood could be hard at times yet still very much worthwhile.
	 comment 18: From the statistic I saw, most of the people on here are Gen Y and Gen Z and if that's true, being a millennial myself, I am ashamed of my generation. I had a sucky life growing up, but man I'm not bitter enough to tell a scared mother to off her child because it's hard. Fat chance.

	 comment 20: I've browsed childfree...can't say I'm not happy they don't want to ever have kids because it's deplorable the things they put down in there. Also the parents that actually agree with them are nuts 'yeah, I call my daughter crotch goblin sometimes because it's hilarious ' do they not think their children might one day hear or see that in the future? I could never call my son anything aside from adorable and my little bub, I don't even call him anything behind his back even when he's being what Blueys dad would call "a pickle".

Post 5: This quote is the bane of my existence.
	comment 1: It’s annoying and presumptuous and ignorant of how prolife outreach actually works.  Unborn babies aren’t floating around in bubbles, they have mothers, who have complicated lives where all of those other qualities intersect.  And if you do more political or cultural activism than direct work with the vulnerable - well then the quote just provides evidence against itself.  We’re trying to get through to people who think like this and speak to us like this.
	comment 2: Exactly. The preborn are one of the few minorities so defenseless and vulnerable they canʼt even voice their grievances and resist discriminatory violence.

Which is precisely why they need the greatest empathy and compassion.

This is where the rights of all other minorities and protected groups originate. In the womb.

	 comment 2: Whoa this is reddit, reasonableness is not acceptable here. Mods???
	comment 3: Of course its a man
	comment 4: So, a guy named “Roychowdhury” chowed half a burrito, apparently in a hurry, as he was escaping to “Guatemala”.  DNA on the other half of the burrito proved his history of firebombing. Someone noticed the writing on the wall. The writing in Wisconsin just happens to match the writing at (of all places) the Capitol.

Considering that we still can’t get to the guy responsible for orchestrating the nation’s Capitol attack, it seems miraculous, like a movie script,  that no burrito was left unturned and Roy was snatched for attacking an empty office. Regardless, Roychowedinahurry produces nice cursive.  That should come in handy while writing home from prison.

Post 9: How getting my autism diagnosis changed my opinion on abortion
	comment 1: I’m autistic, too. And yeah, it’s a sobering realization that most people are perfectly fine with preventing almost all autistic people from being born. It makes you realize what they really think of us and our value and what atrocities allowing elective abortion inevitably leads to.
	comment 2: Yes, that is absolutely true. It's mind-boggling to see some autistic advocates argue against prenatal testing for autism (which is very much on the table at this point), then argue for abortion rights. Advocating for disabled people starts in the womb.
	 comment 3: They’ve sold out the most vulnerable members of the community to keep their progressive membership card. It’s disgusting and pathetic.
	comment 4: Saying people like you, or anyone with any kind of disability or inherent struggle (even something like poverty) should never have been born in the first place is just eugenics in disguise. It’s evil.
	 comment 5: Not even much of a disguise.
	comment 6: That’s beautiful. It is also what we need more of, intellectual honesty. Thank you for taking the time to actually think this through.
	comment 7: I am Aspergers and it is one of the reasons that I dislike abortion is because I hate the idea of being alive and a fellow Asperger being aborted. They are my people and I want a good life for them.
	comment 8: Being on the spectrum also played a part in my dislike for abortion.
	comment 9: My daughter is autistic. During the process of parenting I have concluded that I am as well. 

I have come to the same conclusions as you only I get furious - that anyone would ever tell me it would be better if she never existed
	comment 10: I’m so glad you are with us and that your stance has changed. Human life is precious. ALL human life is worthy of defense and protection!
	comment 11: Autism isn’t a disability.
	 comment 12: It is a developmental disability and is recognized as such in the ADA and current medical literature. Where did you hear that it isn't a disability?
	 comment 13: It is. Being born blind might make you better at hearing,but it's still a disability.
	 comment 14: It can be. Depends on your level of autism.

Some autists are introverted and socially awkward, but fully capable of leading an independent life, excelling at work, ect. For those people, autism might not be a disability.

Some autists can't speak, can't read and write, can't use a toilet and and can't feed themselves. For those people, autism *is* a disability.
	comment 15: Without a doubt, if fetal diagnosis of autism is possible and high percent accuracy, there will be soo many abortions due to it.

One huge issue is a diagnosis of autism doesn't mean the child will necessarily be low functioning.
Most people with autism are high functioning.

So I'm estimating people will abort purely out of fear that the child will be low functioning. Despite there being no way to tell in the diagnosis, yet.

Post 10: I should have said "perpetual" instead of "endless." Opportunity wasted! Anyway, yes, our group is run by atheists.

It is possible to be a feminist (equal rights; equal pay; the pay gap is real; politics and business and education and nursing deserve women in leading positions; down with toxic masculinity; a worrying amount of men do and say ignorant vile stupid things to women; dads can do childcare too; women can fly fighter jets and lift injured colleagues into rescue helicopters) and pro-life.

This seems to me to be a blatant example of mod favoritism based on ideological lines. What’s going on here?
	 comment 3: >What’s going on here?


From my uninformed opinion, it looks like a pro life mod is making arguments for a pro life user when the user didn't originally make an argument at all.


Is that common around here? Do mods make arguments for users when those users fail to make an argument themselves?
	 comment 4: And another mod is [seemingly trying to excuse it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1864fon/well_well_wellif_it_isnt_more_babies_saved_from/kbad42h/). This is not the first “miscommunication” either.

	 comment 10: Hi, there! I went to look this over but it seems u/kingacesuited is taking care of it.

My deepest apologies for not being able to get to it quickly. For future reference, I am probably not the best moderator to tag if you need something looked at super quickly. I have incredibly long work weeks and a family to care for, so that really hinders my ability to tackle issues as promptly as I would like. But I still appreciate you reaching out and I hope your issue has been resolved.

	 comment 13: u/Pregnant_Silence, please unblock u/SayNoToJamBands

I think it's been awhile since you have been active, but we have gotten stricter on users blocking other users because it affected many users' ability to interact on threads.

I do ask, SayNo' that when you choose to disengage with someone you simply stop engaging with them. If I decided to, I could never speak to you again and even if you offered to send me money, insulted my mother, or gripped my vocal cords with your bare hands, I wouldn't have a conversation with you.

Please next time you decide to disengage (make it now mabye?) just don't respond.

edit: Funny side story, anecdote. I play poker (hence the name) and I've made a lot of money off not saying hello to other poker players when they say hello to me. Puts them on tilt. Silence and not responding can actually make you money.
	comment 14: The user u/Pregnant_Silence is now refusing the mods request to unblock me, claiming "memory issues" would prevent them from remembering to not engage with me?


Excuse me, but how tf are their so called "memory issues" my problem? Why is this user being allowed to ignore the rules and the mods requests, interfering with *my* ability to properly engage with other users?


Edit: I felt like this should be addressed as well. In this meta thread, u/Pregnant_Silence claims that *they* blocked *me* due to "bad faith". Hmmmm. Okay yeah let's look at that a bit.


Here, is where *I* told them to move on, to no longer engage with me:


https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/s/Is0LAyNB2r


As *everyone* can see, u/Pregnant_Silence told me that they were going to "move on", as in go away and no longer engage with me. Instead, they *continued* to pester me for another half hour, until getting frustrated and blocking *me*.


How is this behavior being allowed? They told me they were going away, didn't go away, continued to pester me, once they got frustrated *they* blocked me, maliciously, to prevent me from engaging with others (when they could've just, ya know, stopped continuously responding to me), and now they're outright refusing the mods request, refusing to acknowledge the rules (there's a whole damn post on weaponized blocking), and they're complaining here in this thread that I am somehow the "bad faith" user in this exchange.


*Ridiculous.*
	comment 15: I asked last week, but received no response from the mods. I will try again this week. What is the policy on a mod interacting with posts or comments from a user they have blocked?

There is no policy that currently forbids a mod from interacting with a post or comment with a user he or she has blocked.

	comment 21: Hey mods, there really needs to be a policy on y'all reporting users for "report abuse" for reporting your own inappropriate or unprofessional rulings.

Getting a 3 day temp ban from the entire site, probably doled out by the moderator in question, for reporting one moderator comment one time that was weeks old, is an abuse of power.

I think the block feature is essential for this sub in particular.  I do not abuse the block feature (I have fewer than 5 users blocked), but I do use it when I encounter a user that to me seems to be engaging persistently in bad faith.  That way, I do not reply to the same user in the future, igniting another firestorm.  I have a pretty bad memory and would not be able to just remember the usernames of these users absent a block. 

I recognize that blocking a user can create issues for the blocked user's ability to reply to a thread, but this is a side-effect of a legitimate block. 

At a minimum, if there really is a rule against blocking, that should be written down somewhere.

	comment 26: I've been posting on this sub for a few days now, and I've noticed a couple of trends. They're pretty hard to overlook and I think everyone can largely agree on them.

First, there aren't many pro-life posters, at least compared to pro-choice. Any given thread is about an 85-15 split. This is quite possibly a consequence of the fact that the pro-choicers universally have no regard for rule 4. Every thread I go to I have to unmask the hidden pro-lifer posts because they've all been spammed with downvotes. Every thread, every pro-life post.

I myself in the few days I've posted here have seen just the users from this board alone drop me several hundred karma in that short amount of time. Now, I actually don't care about karma personally, but I know many Redditors live and die on it. 

So then, my question is what's the goal here? Are the pro-choicers attempting to drive out all dissent and make it an echo chamber? You'd find a debate sub is a pretty lonely place with no one to debate. Or is the thought that there will always be some new pro-lifer that sticks around for a few days before they get swept under the brigading and leaves? I suppose I'm proof that that thought has merit. Am I just overthinking it? You see pro-life tag, you have a visceral reaction and downvote automatically, the consequences of driving them all away never even enter your mind?

This is a genuine question to the pro-choicers.
	 comment 27: You can’t lose “several hundred karma” from this subreddit. The limit is -100 karma 

Downvotes and upvotes are not limited to active users. There are never that many active users on this sub at any one time. What you are likely witnessing with large karma swings are lurkers interacting with comments. 

This is the nature of a public debate forum with a voting mechanism in place. Perhaps consider why the public so strongly dislikes your commentary before automatically assuming it is a conspiracy, because I can assure you that it is not the latter.
	 comment 28: > So then, my question is what's the goal here? 

I don't think there is any unified goal. But generally, people are extremely disgusted by PL ideology and the down-voting is just an expression of that revulsion. Most people are not dumb, so they can see straight through all of the lies and hypocrisy, and more importantly, they can see the REAL WORLD EFFECTS of abortion bans. 

You're getting downvoted because you are arguing in favor of forcing a repressive and regressive dogmatic ideology on to actual thinking feeling persons. You're arguing in favor violating women's human rights and robbing them of their human dignity. You're aruging in favor of forcing women to sustain serious physical injury, mental trauma and even death. And when the effects of abortion bans are brought up, PLers consistently brush these issues aside and refuse to take any accountability for the effects their laws have on society. Which is incredibly hypocritical given the prevalence of the "Responsibility Objection." 

It's kind of like if this were a debate over legal slavery in an era when slavery was illegal, and the slave owners were complaining about getting booed for making arguments about why slavery should be legal.

> Am I just overthinking it?

No, you're just not asking the right questions. 

>  the consequences of driving them all away never even enter your mind?

What consequences?
	 comment 29: > This is quite possibly a consequence of the fact that the pro-choicers universally have no regard for rule 4. Every thread I go to I have to unmask the hidden pro-lifer posts because they've all been spammed with downvotes. Every thread, every pro-life post.

I think the evidence hardly supports that pro-choicers “universally have no regard for rule 4” and making blanket claims like this does you no favors. There are for sure PC who downvote contrary to rule 4. In fact I have experienced an exchange with one of the mods where I my comments were downvoted as they responded to me. I have also had a similar experience with a few regular PL users of this sub, my comments are downvoted as they respond. 
This type of downvoting is unfortunate and I wish downvotes were public, but that is outside of our control. What I try to do to counteract the effects of this downvoting is 1) sort comments by new as a default, 2) turn off the default setting of comments collapsing based on votes received, 3) upvote every comment I read. I initially did 3 as a means of keeping track of what I read, but now it is also my small effort to counteract unnecessary downvoting. I encourage others to consider doing the same.
	 comment 30: >there aren't many pro-life posters, at least compared to pro-choice

This is also just what it's like IRL. In terms of posters, the people with more controversial opinions are less likely to post. 

>have no regard for rule 4.

This usually is due to the lurkers. That's expected, if you say something controversial/fucked up/unempathetic, people are more likely to downvote it. 

> I know many Redditors live and die on it.

Lol then don't say stupid fucked up shit? It's not that hard. 

>Are the pro-choicers attempting to drive out all dissent and make it an echo chamber?

It's a bit of an echo chamber. I think it's because of PL who do post end up getting tons of responses and engagement and that can get overwhelming. Also, many PL are reluctant to post in the first place. I understand why though, it's not easy to post in a place where your views are questioned and challenged. 

>You see pro-life tag, you have a visceral reaction and downvote automatically, the consequences of driving them all away never even enter your mind?

Can't speak for anyone else, but I've never done this. But there's a good chance a lurker or someone else might feel this way.
	 comment 31: Don't get gaslit. It's not solely on the lurkers.

Many regulars on here regularly downvote every time you post a comment; it'll be on 0 by the time you get to replying, and then will simply tank further down -5, -10, -15. You can always blame this on the lurkers, but it's too much of a coincidence. Even innocent questions get nuked if you have a PL flair.  Rule 4 is not much of a rule. It's an unenforceable suggestion that the majority seem to not follow. 

The goal here for PC is to essentially dunk on PL-ers. They are very comfortable in this echo chamber of a sub, and as a result the standard of debating is low. Many have explicitly said they are immovable in their positions. They just use it as an arena to beat PL over the head with rhetoric. This alongside the neglect of topics supplementary to the abortion debate such as debate mechanics and philosophy makes it a smorgasbord of confusion, misunderstandings and a superiority complex. 

The standard of moderation doesn't help either.
	 comment 32: There's never been regard for rule 4. All they'll do is say you're too fixated on imaginary internet points and that you can only lose a maximum of 100 karma on this subreddit. As for downvoting, you have basically two camps. The first is incapable of appreciating a well-written PL comment because they think that all PL arguments are bad or because they deny that any example of a well-written PL comment is actually well-written. They'll try to nitpick anything you show to fervently defend why the comment is actually bad, but innocent PL comments or questions are downvoted and innocent PC comments or questions are upvoted. Many low-effort PC responses get upvoted just because they're PC friendly or made by a PCer. The second camp claim that they only downvote in rare circumstances and shift blame to the lurkers. It could be that users in the second camp rarely downvote, but my experience is that a lot of active debaters, not just spooky lurkers, downvote PL comments very often. It's obvious because you'll get a downvote almost immediately after posting your reply or right before you get a notification for their reply.

I'm all for a UBI for children so that child support is largely unnecessary.  Too often, those who are supposed to pay child support just don't pay at all, and those who do pay often don't pay the full amount, and the person this hurts the most is the child.

	 comment 44: I’m a minority that supports this. But there would have to be an ideal world where a single parent could survive on their own with the baby without going bankrupt or becoming homeless/starving. We know abortion affects people in poverty the most, so this would have to be addressed *before* allowing paper abortions.

I became increasingly sympathetic to PC arguments following a series of recent conversations with sophisticated PC. PL often highlight the salience of “responsibility” and “duty”. To this PC say that no legal duties should be foisted onto women for engaging in consensual sex [consensual sex isn’t a crime!] Just as I felicitate women for **choosing** what’s best for them, so too I felicitate men for **choosing** what’s best for them [even if the former involves abortion and the latter involves severing ties with your offspring.] In my view, neither women nor men should be stopped from having a choice; both should make what they feel is the best decision.

	 comment 3: I don’t think you would have a reason other than the law, at least not a personally beneficial one. Hence we have the law. 

Similar question - what reason, besides brute force of law, would I have to submit to societal demands of not killing, stealing, not parking in a handicapped spot, paying taxes, wearing clothes in public, etc.? What’s in it for me?
	 comment 4: For me I would say performing a non-consensual sacrifice to achieve a goal, regardless of how noble, is generally wrong. We would probably agree on this point in many other scenarios, but the fundamental difference is in relation to pregnancy.

That said, let’s do everything possible to mitigate the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy. Better access to contraception, improved funding, education, maternity rights and so on. We should leave no stone unturned, but what we shouldn’t do is end the life of another person to achieve it. I believe humanity is more creative than that.
	 comment 5: Perhaps if you understood that human life begins at conception and that a ZEF is a human being in an early stage of development the same way an infant or toddler is a human being in an early stage of development, and you also believed that all human beings have equal value and deserve the right to life, then maybe you would agree that not wanting to be pregnant anymore or give birth doesn’t justify the death of your own child.

	comment 7: A little scenario for the PLs here about bodily autonomy.

Should sound familiar, but it's turned around this time, to try and see if you can even fundamentally understand what bodily autonomy is about and why it's important:

Let's say *I* have a moral cause I'm fighting for. Doesn't really matter what it is. The point is that *I* think that it's totally just, and right, and moral, and I think it's *the* most important thing ever. Now, the catch is that my cause requires *your* body and you oh-so-sadly will need to be harmed in the process, and you could even die. Nonetheless, *I* think that my cause is totally worth it, whatever it takes.

Now, in this scenario, this cause is not some fringe position of mine, that nobody else would agree with. Oh, no. In fact, I have a whole movement of moral and upstanding and righteous people to stand by my side, who support my cause and also think it's the most important thing ever, and they would *all* gladly give their own body and endure any harm and risk everything for the cause (even those who fundamentally can't, but just trust me on this, they *totally* would!), because it's *obviously* the only moral and right thing to do, so why wouldn't *you,* too? And we need you to do it!

But the thing is: *You* just don't agree with our cause. Or maybe you even would agree with it, in principle, and think it's a wonderful thing to do, if someone so chooses, but *you* still don't want to sacrifice yourself on behalf of it. It scares you and you don't want to be hurt! But, again, it doesn't really matter what your reasons are, the point is that *you* just want *nothing* to do with it, no matter what, and that's *final,* and you tell us to go kick rocks, because it's *your* body and your life, so we cannot just force you and use you as a means to an end!

But I and my people won't be satisfied with this! We just cannot grasp for the lifes of us why anyone would ever disagree and choose not to contribute to our cause, and we think it's a grievous moral wrong, a crime even, to selfishly withhold your body like this, so we'll *not* accept your refusal, and we'll *make* you do it, no matter what it takes, no matter how long, even if you're kicking and screaming bloody murder, your body *will* be put to use for the greater good! And if you still don't accept it, we'll throw you in jail and threaten anyone who may help you escape our grasp, as well!

Now, how does that sound for you? I and my people, we're obviously the good guys in this scenario, right?

The *only* time I see pro choice people bring this up is in response to the pro life mantra of "women are responsible for pregnancy, therefore she must gestate against her will" argument.


Really it doesn't matter who caused a pregnancy or who's supposedly "responsible" for the pregnancy coming to be. If a woman *is* currently pregnant and doesn't want to be, she can make the choice to carry the pregnancy or not.


However when pro life people jump to "She caused the pregnancy! It's *her* fault for becoming pregnant!!" it makes sense to point out that women *do not* control their eggs or implantation. Women do not have control over making a zef implant into their uteruses. If they did, infertility and unwanted pregnancy wouldn't be an issue.


Men however, *do* have control over where they shoot their sperm.


I hope this clears up your misunderstanding.

	comment 2: PC operate within the parameters of reality. Women don’t get abortions at 41 weeks for shits and giggles but PL obfuscate and distract by creating silly hypotheticals to flex their intellectual muscles as the effects of abortion bans rear their ugly head. There’s something unthinkably disturbing about using this as a playground to play with farcical abstractions at the cost of oppression.
	comment 3: It depends on the context. If you’re having like a political debate on TV, then yeah, bringing up the most extreme case you possibly imagine to try to make your opponent look bad is unfair. It’s also unfair when pro-choicers do it.

But in general, there’s nothing wrong with exploring the far edges of someone’s position. Watermelon made a post a while ago asking if pro-lifers would still want abortion banned even if it resulted in a net loss of life, and some pro-lifers actually said yes! That’s helpful, because it reveals something about the ethical principles that underlie the pro-life position. Likewise for questions about extremely late abortions.
	 comment 4: >most extreme case you possibly imagine to try to make your opponent look bad is unfair. It’s also unfair when pro-choicers do it.

	 comment 6: The difference I would see between what PC advocates bring up and what PL advocates bring up is reality.

The PC advocates are talking practical reality and PL advocates are talking about pure hypotheticals.  

I don’t see why it would be important for me to know how a politician would handle immigration and border security if humans teleported, and this ‘abortion moments before birth’ is similarly far fetched.
	comment 7: >To me, the constant accusations of PC desiring to abort babies in the final weeks of pregnancy is about as silly as when PC claim that a fetus is not human or that it’s not alive.

It's probably brought up because it's a logical entailment of their position (especially bodily autonomy absolutists), whereas the other 2 are essentially false claims. Someone making a hypothetical with extemely late abortions doesn't commit them to any stance on how often they occur or whether they occur at all.

>Meaning that they also know why bringing up UUTMOB is so irrational

What do you mean by irrational?

>So what’s the deal? Why continue using the argument or continue tolerating its use?

It's brought up because it is an entailment of many PC positions. It's meant to show a distasteful conclusion of the views held. Feeling uncomfortable about late term abortions is a chink in the armour of a PC-er, especially if they are heavy proponents of absolute bodily autonomy - and PL-ers know this.
	 comment 8: Don’t you think it’s irresponsible to use a hypothetical (which happens so infrequently that the numbers are approaching zero) as a primary support for laws which irrevocably and massively impact real people? Personally, I find myself aggravated when I hear PC arguments that I find to be weak, as I think it weakens the movement as a whole. It surprises me that PL don’t seem to have the same reaction to weak arguments such as this one.

By irrational I mean that it’s a stupid argument about something that doesn’t happen. And if one were so steadfast in their anti-abortion beliefs, it wouldn’t occur to me that they’d bother making arguments that don’t make sense.

 I fail to see what is so distasteful about recognizing that term limits on abortions only punish women with complications in their wanted pregnancies. Sure, there are plenty of PC who are bodily autonomy absolutists, but that doesn’t represent the motivation of the majority of PC in keeping abortion legal at all stages. At least not as far as I can tell.

I find it regrettable and shameful that PL are willing to sacrifice women (who were doing what they’re “supposed” to do, might I add) on the altar of some opportunistic “chink in the armor” of a good-faith position held by PC.
	 comment 9: > Feeling uncomfortable

So it’s an appeal to emotion fallacy?
	 comment 10: The only way to abort a pregnancy after about 30 weeks is via c-section or induced labor. That's pretty much the only safe for the mother way to get a fetus that big out of her body. At which point, it's pretty much just early delivery.

So in order for it to turn into an abortion, they would have to inject the fetus or amniotic fluid with something.

But that has absolutely nothing to do with bodily autonomy. It also wouldn't end gestation.
	 comment 11: >  It's meant to show a distasteful conclusion of the views held

A so-called "conclusion" that has no bearing on reality has no bearing on the PC position.

> Feeling uncomfortable

Any "discomfort" you think you are sensing is probably coming from the second-hand embarrassment people get from seeing how desperate PLers are to spin this into a valid argument. 

> and PL-ers know this

PLers may delude themselves into believing they have great argument here, but it's really just a big'ol nothing-burger.

 But extremely late abortions do occur. They're to save the pregnant woman's life. 

If something goes wrong in late pregnancy and the woman's going to die if she doiesn't have an abortion, you think the woman should just die?
	comment 13: Its an easy win for PL and the logical conclusion for many PC position. If there is not a right to life and the woman has the bodily autonomy to get an abortion, why should it matter if it’s at 3 weeks, 3 months, or 9 months? 

You see it on the other side too where PC always bring up cases of rape, despite the vast majority of abortions being done on healthy pregnancies. Both sides lead with their best foot forward and it’s difficult to argue in favor of abortion up until birth or that a rape survivor should now be forced to be pregnant and give birth against their will.
	 comment 14: > If there is not a right to life and the woman has the bodily autonomy to get an abortion, why should it matter if it’s at 3 weeks, 3 months, or 9 months? 

Well, it does matter. Capricious last-second abortions are not a real thing, but medically necessary abortions do happen in the third trimester, and restriction on abortions later in pregnancy only put women's lives in unnecessary danger. I think you would be very hard pressed to find single PCer who would say that these women's lives don't matter.

>  it’s difficult to argue in favor of abortion up until birth

No it's not. I just did it. It wasn't hard at all.
	 comment 15: I'm PC and supportive of abortions at any time period, and yet I am fully capable of understanding that doesn't actually result in abortions occuring up until the moment of birth.

The issue is that PLers do not, or cannot, understand medical ethics. They actually demonstrate this on the sub quite regularly.

> You see it on the other side too where PC always bring up cases of rape

Not really comparable, since rape actually happens and abortions as a result of rape are far more likely to occur than a person carrying a pregnancy for 9 months up and "changes their mind". It's also in line with reality and doesn't contradict medical ethics, so it's REALLY not comparable to this common PL nonsense talking point.

> Both sides lead with their best foot forward

BA for PCers and a huge "OOF" for PLers 😂

No, it's not...?

What exactly do you mean by "easy win"? Is it like that pigeon winning a chess game by knocking down the pieces, crapping on the board and flying off? Because I don't really see how one can win anything without presenting an argument.

	comment 2: How did this get to the cops in the first place? I'm assuming she didn't call 911 over a clogged toilet...

This whole case is absurd. As if Americans don't already have enough reason to not want to involve police when they're actually needed, let's add fear of felony charges for a nonviable fetus miscarriage.

I hate it here.
	 comment 3: I imagine she called 911 because she wanted emergency medical help. Another horrible example of why Americans can’t rely upon emergency services. Cops kill the people they’ve been summoned to help, too.
	 comment 4: Someone called the police for a "death investigation".  It doesn't say who called though. 

"[According to](https://www.wfmj.com/story/49778695/warren-woman-charged-with-abuse-of-corpse-after-death-of-baby) a police report, an officer was called to Watts' home...on the afternoon of Friday, September 22 for a death investigation."  


Maybe someone was there with Watts (the woman who miscarried) or she talked to someone and they were suspicious about how the pregnancy ended (thought she aborted) or how the fetus died (thought it was born alive and left to die or killed)?
	 comment 5: i’m guessing she told a person in her life about her miscarriage, not knowing the person she told was a PL extremist, and the PL extremist went straight to the police. :/
	comment 6: > When will you listen to PC about the consequences of PL legislation, we are proven right again and again.

At a certain point we can only conclude that this is all by design and hurting women is the point.
	 comment 7: And for those of us paying attention, that point was a looooooong time ago.
	comment 8: Of course she’s a black woman. I called this like last year the women who will be penalized the most from PL laws will be women of color but mainly black women.

Don’t expect to see any PL in this thread they always ignore what doesn’t fit their narrative
	 comment 9: No PLers are brave or honest enough (probably because of how goddamn disgusting it is) to say that this is the intended response to these situations under their draconian laws.

They'll write this off as collateral damage.
	comment 10: The most insane thing to me is that she went to the hospital *twice* for help and they turned her away. Then she miscarried in her toilet. The article says that she then “went about her day.” You know … she might not have been at the top of her game because she had just delivered a large fetus through her genitalia on her own after being denied healthcare and she may have been kind of traumatized! I honestly don’t know what people think women are supposed to do in horrific situations like this.
	 comment 11: i have a theory that PL’s just generally assume that anybody/everybody who claims to have had a natural miscarriage is just lying and actually chose to abort on purpose.  unless it’s themself or somebody they know personally of course. 🙄
	comment 12: So I did stumble onto a blog post on the PL’s perception of this case and apparently the main sticking point for them is that because the pregnancy was spontaneously aborted after 20 weeks, that classified as a “stillbirth” rather than a “miscarriage” which is, according to the argument, the point at which we should punish someone for trying to flush the remains of their fetus rather than fishing them out. They are trying to assign personhood after 20 weeks by clinging to the term “stillbirth”, and I don’t know enough about medical terms to know why we would differentiate at that point, except to inform their medical policy going forward, but I’m pretty sure the intention wasn’t to inform potential mothers that they were legally obliged to consider their fetus as a person at this point. 

PL aren’t going to say that the stillbirth was illegal, but they are fully willing to punish a traumatized, injured victim for not sharing their *opinion* that the nonviable fetus was a fully realized human being.

Post 5: Why I don’t care about the Killing vs Letting Die distinction

	comment 2: > My view is that it doesn’t matter if abortion is killing or letting die. The killing vs letting die distinction to me seems like semantic squabbling. 

I think it is too. I have seen people who are PL but exceptions make the claim that an abortion is killing, but performing the same procedure or a similar procedure with the same outcome is letting die if it is one of their exceptions. This distinction is actually the basis for people who specifically think that salpingectomy is the only acceptable procedure for an ectopic pregnancy since it is the only one they perceive as letting die.
	 comment 3: PL, in my experience, make the distinction only with how they feel about the reason for the abortion or how they judge the morality of the person getting the abortion. It has nothing to do with anything in reality - it’s all about their perception.
	comment 4: Its irrelevant before viability.
	comment 5: The main reason I think the distinction between killing and letting die is irrelevant in this debate is that 95% of the time 'letting die' is an effective alternative to killing.

Research shows that medical abortions (letting die) are effective right up to mid way through the second trimester. Now they are usually not used much after the first tri when 'killing' is the more effective and safer option, but if alternative procedures were not available then then would still work most of the time.
	comment 6: The use of the term "killing" is a silly appeal to emotion and nothing more. Prolifers don't really believe me having an abortion at six weeks is exactly the equivalent of me killing my ten year old.

	 comment 5: Indeed. For a person living in an abortion ban state, o one consequence is they need to have to decide on abortion promptly, in order to  be able to have a self-managed telemedicine abortion (or organise travel out of state). They can't afford time for thought.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is one reason for an increased abortion rate. 

Plus, anyone living in an abortion ban state who knows they have a higher-than-average chance of something going wrong,  the sensible thing to do is to have a precautionary abortion while it can be easily managed, since otherwise they could be heading into danger with no help in sight. 

Good thing prolifers don't care about *preventing* abortions.

	comment 2: If more men were willing to step up and take care of their disabled infants, fewer women would choose abortion. Fact.
	 comment 3: That is probably true. That being said, if men would take responsibility for their own sperm there would be fewer unintended pregnancies.

But then, prolife has very little to say about controlling men.
	 comment 4: Sad fact is we can't even statistically get men to take care of an ill wife. You want him to go even a step farther and take care of a kid?
	comment 5: Mother is the female parent of a child, father is the male parent of a child. The duties and obligations of parenthood are generally unique to each couple and a lot more fluid now than they used to be. For my family personally, we have fairly traditional roles with my primary role as a provider and my wife largely the nurturer. There's obviously more to it, overlap and such, but the broad gist is that.

1. As a pro-lifer, I do believe that the woman should give birth and that there's a kid at the end of the pregnancy, yes.
2. No. I wouldn't want a child to stay with someone that doesn't want him or won't love him. I wholeheartedly endorse adoption for any unwanted children after birth.

3 & 4. That's a bit longer to explain. First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent. Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice the legal consensus is that father has no say in it. But he DOES automatically have a legal and financial obligation. If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing. 

But that alone isn't the sum of the issue. The government will frequently receive the money from child support. A mother might not ask for a dime from the father but if she uses public services, the father might still have to pay. This has been found true in cases where the father was just a donor and it had been understood he would not be involved or have any rights to the child. The government didn't care and demanded their pound of flesh regardless. And as often as the rape scenario comes up in the abortion talk, it does happen that a man can be raped against his will (often statutorily), become an unwilling parent, and have to financially compensate his rapist with child support. Further, the court can charge more money than a man actually earns in child support if they just believe that he can do better. And there's no way out of under the debt. Bankruptcy does not discharge child support. It's pauper's jail for him.

All that said though? I don't actually oppose child support. I think it's a corrupt system, fraught with things that need to be overhauled and addressed, but the basic premise I firmly agree with. The welfare of the child is paramount. The father has no less an obligation just because he didn't carry the child.
	 comment 6: okay so how do you define parent? 

>First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent.

you mean like the rights to not ejaculate inside a woman?

> If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing. 

he's the only one who controls where he ejaculates. that is not inequality

> This has been found true in cases where the father was just a donor and it had been understood he would not be involved or have any rights to the child. The government didn't care and demanded their pound of flesh regardless.

source? 
 
>it does happen that a man can be raped against his will (often statutorily), become an unwilling parent, and have to financially compensate his rapist with child support.

I believe that's happened once, total. also, a woman was forced to pay child support TO HER RAPIST after she was not allowed to abort her child. it goes both ways, it's shitty both ways. allowing abortion is one of the best solutions.

>Further, the court can charge more money than a man actually earns in child support if they just believe that he can do better. 

what's wrong with this? I fully support this. a man shouldn't be allowed to work a super low paying job just to get out of paying decent child support money 

>And there's no way out of under the debt. Bankruptcy does not discharge child support. It's pauper's jail for him.

shouldn't have ejaculated inside a woman. 

> I think it's a corrupt system

how so?
	 comment 7: > First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent. Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice the legal consensus is that father has no say in it.

There's no inequality. The man has a right to do what he wishes with his own body, and should take responsibility for that. In fully-consensual sex, it's entirely the man's responsibility where he puts his penis and where he ejaculates. If he causes an unwanted pregnancy, it's then entirely the woman's responsibility to decide what to do with her own body - whether to continue the pregnancy or terminate. Complete equality.

Obviously, if the man's decided to risk engendering an unwanted pregnancy, it's his responsibility if she needs to abort: and if she decides to have a baby,  the baby is owed child support by both parents. Generally, the man ends up paying financially and the woman ends up paying the higher cost of personal care. So it's not *quite* equality, as a child usually costs a man less to have than a woman.
	 comment 8: >As a pro-lifer, I do believe that the woman should give birth and that there's a kid at the end of the pregnancy, yes.

Correction: you want to force women to give birth. Take responsibility for your beliefs.

>No. I wouldn't want a child to stay with someone that doesn't want him or won't love him. I wholeheartedly endorse adoption for any unwanted children after birth.  
>  
>3 & 4. That's a bit longer to explain. First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent. Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice the legal consensus is that father has no say in it. 

Men have complete and total control over their own reproductive role. You don't get a "say" in what a woman does with her body, just like she doesn't get a "say" in what you do with yours. 

>But he DOES automatically have a legal and financial obligation. If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing.

What "needs addressing"? You have no say in what someone else does with your body. A woman getting or not getting an abortion isn't a violation of your rights, since you have no right to her body. Very illuminating that you apparently think you do.

>But that alone isn't the sum of the issue. The government will frequently receive the money from child support.

Cutting a check every month to which their child is \*entitled\* to is not oppression. And, if the billions in unpaid child support if anything to go by, the laws themselves are not enforced appropriately. Take a look at financial situations of single mothers vs. (largely non-custodial) single fathers before you start abloo-blooing about how oppressed men are for having to the the absolute bare minimum.

I find it hilarious how the same PL men who demand women suffer immense pain, humiliation, and lifelong trauma to gestate and birth unwanted ZEFs will crumple into a sad little pile over having to potentially cut a check.
	 comment 9: >First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent. Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice the legal consensus is that father has no say in it.

In my state, that is not true.  If a couple is married and not legally separated at the time of birth, he is listed on the birth certificate automatically, same as the mother, so he gets parental rights at the exact same moment she does.  Prior to the birth certificate, there is no legal parent here to grant parental rights to.  (If they aren't married, he needs to sign an affidavit of paternity attesting that he is the father before he can be named on the birth certificate.)

> If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing.

Since he can't take over gestation for her, I don't see the inequality there.  If she does keep it and he doesn't want any legal or physical custody of the child, he is not required to take it, so he is free to not parent this child.

>A mother might not ask for a dime from the father but if she uses public services, the father might still have to pay.

All for not insisting custodial parents get a child support agreement in place in order to receive public services.

>This has been found true in cases where the father was just a donor and it had been understood he would not be involved or have any rights to the child. 

That is not the case in my state at all.  Sperm donors are well protected from ever having to pay for child support, assuming they go through a legal process to be a sperm donor.  

>And as often as the rape scenario comes up in the abortion talk, it does happen that a man can be raped against his will (often statutorily), become an unwilling parent

In my state, there is protection against this.  He would not be listed on the birth certificate, as he would either have a pending legal separation or never be married to his rapist.  He cannot be listed on the birth certificate without an affidavit of paternity, and my state doesn't follow the relevant Illinois ruling and would not demand he sign an affidavit of paternity or pay child support.  

>Further, the court can charge more money than a man actually earns in child support if they just believe that he can do better. 

In my state, child support is capped at 25% of your adjusted gross income based on the previous year's state tax filing and can be revised at any time with a quarterly income filing.  Child support is capped at $15,000 a month, regardless of how much money one has, so you could have private army money and 10 kids by three different women, but you'd never pay more than $15,000 a month total.

>It's pauper's jail for him.

My state, like all US states, does not have a pauper's or debtors jail.
	 comment 10: >Mother is the female parent of a child, father is the male parent of a child.

Quite cishet of you. What about people who fall outside the gender binary? What about a pregnant person who doesn't want to be referred to as a "mother?" Is that something you would respect? I ask because a lot of PL, unsurprisingly, don't.

>The duties and obligations of parenthood

Where does this come from?

>I do believe that the woman should give birth and that there's a kid at the end of the pregnancy, yes.

Why do you feel entitled to demand women give birth?

>I wholeheartedly endorse adoption for any unwanted children after birth.

How come? I thought there are duties and obligations that come with parenthood. What happened to those?

>If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing.

Why should he get a say in what happens to her body? The "baseline inequality" is that, currently, only AFABs can gestate.

>The welfare of the child is paramount.

I call bullshit. If so, you wouldn't be "wholeheartedly endorsing adoption" aka legalized child trafficking. I work in the foster care system, I see this shit up close and it's mad fucked up.
	 comment 11: Excuse me what finacial obligation at all does he have before birth? And women have the exact same post birth obligation plus end up caring for the kid physically in or out of a relationship.
	 comment 12: I think that a lot of people are demanding the woman do both providing (work full time) AND childcare.  There are multiple studies showing women who work full time STILL do more chores & childcare.  That's just a recipe for caretaker burnout and resentment and dead bedrooms.  

I notice that you allow way more nuance with deadbeat dads.  

People make a stink about child support but less than half of custodial parents get the full amount.

[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-tps03.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-tps03.html)

"Approximately two-thirds (69.3 percent) of custodial parents who were due child support received some payments from noncustodial parents, while only 43.5 percent reported receiving the full amount of child support due. "

Also even if the non-custodial parent actually DID pay half of what it takes to raise the kid, the custodial parent is still fucking screwed if said non-custodial parent never does any of the labor like partial custody is granted but the non-custodial parent skips a lot of visitation.

	comment 6: That the PL arguments still have not made much progression since Roe v Wade was initially passed. And that they are not willing to listen to what people want in order to get legislation through, regardless of any concerns. Even going so far as to dishonestly put forward a limit that they know they will whittle down later or pushing bans on contraceptives.

I was willing to make compromises but currently the PL is trying to ban abortion completely and willing to be deceptive to do it. It doesn’t help their arguments or cause at all.
	 comment 7: Yes definitely. To be honest, I don't trust PL at all. They are the type to take a mile when you give an inch. 

Every post on here asking PL about what compromises they are willing to make, the most common one I see is "life threat." Which is so fucked up?? That is NOT a compromise, that should already be on the roster. The fact that so many PL think of a life threat as compromise just tells me that they would rather these people die but they will begrudgingly compromise because they know how fucked up it is if they don't.
	 comment 8: Good point. I was willing to have the compromise that Roe v Wade was, but now that I've seen it overturned and that PL won't take a compromise - I've realized that I can't have one either. We can't stop until our bodily autonomy when it comes to abortion is clearly enshrined in law. Whatever happened to ERA?
	comment 9: > Someone seeking an abortion who is denied an abortion (and has no other way to access it) now has to continue the pregnancy regardless of if they want to or not.

This is slavery if a pregnancy is continued against her will, and not just during pregnancy, but for the next 18 years after the birth.

Abortion bans are the breeding ground for gestational slavery.

While I believe that the right to one's own body should be absolute and inherent, I can respect this.
	comment 13: You're arguing from a false premise. Many rights that we all have at some points are not available to us at others. It doesn't mean we suddenly don't have rights. One of the examples I generally use for this strawman is intercourse. You have the right to sleep with another consenting person if you want, right?

A five year old doesn't have that right. Does that mean they suddenly have no rights? That they are required to be celibate their entire lives? That the government can issue weekly hymen checks to ensure that they can never possibly have sex?

No, that's ludicrous. Like arguing that because you can't abort your child other people now have carte blanche access to your body and you're a slave to their will.

Rights evolve. Many are conditional. Your right to freedom can be suspended if you commit a crime. Your right to travel does not extend to unlawful trespass. Your right to commerce doesn't allow you to purchase illegal items or services. None of these mean you're suddenly without rights at all.
	 comment 14: >You're arguing from a false premise. Many rights that we all have at some points are not available to us at others. It doesn't mean we suddenly don't have rights. 

The specific argument for prolifers is: When a woman or a child is pregnant, she ceases to have human rights. Basic human rights, inalienable, which every other human has from birth to death: for prolifers, pregnancy simply makes her less than human.

Now, you are trying to argue that other rights can't be exercised at some times, like a five year old not having the "right" to intercourse. (A very odd "right" for you to pick on, since most people don't think of sexual intercourse with a consenting partner as a "right" but as a joy and pleasure.) 

But the human rights which are necessarily violated by prolifers in imposing abortion bans aren't "this is the wrong time for you to exercise this right" rights - these are rights which are upheld by free access to abortion on demand and violated by abortion denial.
	 comment 15: >Many rights that we all have at some points are not available to us at other (points).

Of course a 5yr old doesn't, they don't even know consent is let alone comprehend consent or sex and what it can or does entail, because they are a child. 

>Does that mean they suddenly have no rights?

No that means they have limited abilities to consent to certain things, but they still have rights and this is where the limited rights come into play unlike adults who are able to consent and acknowledge comprehension. 

>That they are required to be celibate their entire lives?

They shouldn't be engaging in sex until they are of age to know what consent is or even sex. An adult can't have sex with the child either. 

>That the government can issue weekly hymen checks to ensure that they can never possibly have sex?

I would consider that an intrusive bodily check for absolutely no reason besides to appease PL and their beliefs. 


>No, that's ludicrous. Like arguing that because you can't abort your child other people now have carte blanche access to your body and you're a slave to their will.

How is that ludicrous, when someone wants an abortion but that access is banned?  They are essentially held a slave against their will because of PL ideology.

Yes, obviously. The examples you gave are due to illegal actions someone took. Those examples are punishments. Is this you admitting that gestation is nothing more than a way to punish people for having sex?
	 comment 19: >That the government can issue weekly hymen checks to ensure that they can never possibly have sex?


"This belief that the hymen provides physical "proof" of sexual history is the premise of virginity testing, a practise condemned by the World Health Organization in 2018 as a human rights violation. Such tests can take different forms; everything from physical examinations of measuring a hymen or vaginal laxity to wedding night rituals where a bloodied bedsheet is expected to appear, and even be shown to the bride and groom's families.

Despite this having no scientific basis – and despite virginity itself being a social construct with no biological reality – millions around the world continue to believe that a woman's sexual history is somehow writ into her anatomy, and that all cisgender women bleed the first time that they have sex. 

The hymen is a small, membranous tissue that may be found near the opening of the vagina. It is really quite incredible that a tiny piece of seemingly purposeless tissue has been ascribed so much factually inaccurate purpose. 

Many people erroneously believe that the hymen seals over the vagina, not realising that that would mean a woman wouldn't be able to menstruate (a minority of people do have this condition, and can get a hymenectomy to help open the channel). Instead, most hymens have an annular or crescent-moon shape, and may take many forms of varying thinness and thickness. Few of us would have been told that it can change with age, that some of us aren't born with one, or that it might totally disappear by the time we enter sexual maturity anyway. Or that a wide variety of activity can stretch or tear it, from exercise to masturbation to, yes, penetrative sex.


But this doesn't mean there's any validity to the idea that you can ascertain sexual activity with a hymen examination. One small study of 36 pregnant teenagers published in 2004, for example, found that medical staff were only able to make "definitive findings of penetration" in two cases. Another 2004 study found that 52% of sexually active adolescent girls interviewed had "no identifiable changes to the hymenal tissue". A binary idea that either we are sexually active and have no visible hymen, or that we aren't sexually active and do have one, is simply not accurate. 

Blood on the bedsheet, a type of virginity test used around the world, is also based on falsehoods. Some hymens may bleed when first stretched if the act is abrupt or if you aren't relaxed, but any blood is actually far more likely to come from lacerations to the vaginal wall due to forceful sex or a lack of lubrication. Bleeding from first-time sex may or may not happen, just like bleeding from anytime sex may or may not happen. Reasons for bleeding during sex include feeling anxious, not being fully aroused or experiencing some aggravation from things like infections. When one obstetrician surveyed 41 of her colleagues, asking them if they bled the first time they had sex or not, 63% of them said that they had not."

Lol how you whine about nuance and say this in the same breath?

Everything I said stands:

\-their body isn't theirs to decide what to do with --> pregnant people cannot decide what to do with their body.

\--saying no or what you want doesn't matter --> pregnant people cannot say no to continue a pregnancy. someone who wants an abortion will be denied one because them wanting one does not matter.

\--other people have the right to demand by who, when, why, and how long your body is used --> PL demand pregnant people allow the ZEF to use their body until the gestation is complete.

Which of this is incorrect? Which of this is not "specific enough?" I didn't think I had to give examples for each, but clearly I was wrong.

However you said "kill humans if you feel like it" is just downright incorrect. When you have to downplay abortion and gestation to *this*, I call bullshit.

ETA:

>telling kids that’s it’s acceptable to kill human beings if you feel like it.

1. There's a difference between letting die and killing, but I'm okay with conceding here.
2. I have *zero* qualms about telling kids that it's acceptable to use any amount of force necessary to remove and/or stop someone from being inside, harming, and using their body against their will. So actually, you're fucking wrong because I am VERY comfortable telling kids that.

No, it's misleading because it's **not true.** It's not our position. It's PL's position; it's their straw man.

Your 'explanation' for why it's a misleading statement is also misleading, unsurprisingly, and again, not because it's non-specific but because it's simply not true. But 'non-specific', lol - how else would one 'explain' chronic untruthfulness one cannot defend and lacks the moral resolve to correct, ever?

This is disingenuous. PC have never once claimed that PL are forcing people to have sex, and framing your side as "we simply want to protect life" completely ignores the actual issue. 

You're trying to force people to have their bodies used non-consensually so your feelings aren't hurt about the death of another person. That's controlling what another person does with their body. 

To put this another way, it would be like preventing someone from backing out of sexual intercourse when they have made it clear they do not wish to continue. That's controlling someone's body.

An abortion isn’t a ‘desire’ it’s a necessity for a start for some girls and women. 

>its saying that Morality is defined by an objective, a Creator who is above us its using logic with morals and not dictating it by subjective garbage, 

You can keep your religion to yourself, it doesn’t apply to anyone who doesn’t believe in it. I don’t believe any god (including yours) created me and I don’t follow your religion so do not have to abide by the laws of your religion. 

>if you define morality by opinion you cant be right ever, every opinion differs so everything is good and bad evil and righteous it’s incompatible. 

Okay, then you have no right to determine is abortion is moral based on your opinion that women are doing it because they ‘desire’ killing the ZEF. You don’t have any right to determine that sex before marriage is immoral or contraception use is immoral because it is based on your *opinion* that comes from your religion. Unless of course you can objectively prove that sex before marriage or contraception use is immoral *without* appealing to your god or religious book. 

>Its teaching that the consent of this begins at sex, 

Consent to one thing is not consent to another and consent cannot be transferred. Consent is given to sex (at which point the ZEF doesn’t even exist), not to the continued gestation of a ZEF that may or may not come in to existence. 

>its teaching that violations of human rights via slaughter of the fetus is not okay even if the father is a garbage human being a rapist a whatever. 

For a start, abortion access is deemed a human right and no foetus is ‘slaughtered’ especially considering most abortions are done by pill and all that does is stop the woman’s body producing a hormone which stops the pregnancy continuing. Oh and forcing a girl or woman to give birth to a baby conceived in rape is utterly disgusting and shows how little you value women and their suffering. I believe anyone without a rape exception is just as bad as any rapist as you are forcing someone to be continuously violated for you and your beliefs; it’s never about what’s best for the victim. 

>Its teaching you don’t own and have dominion over other human beings in any stage of life. 

Dominion is a religious concept and doesn’t apply to those of us who are not religious. Also, I have control over my body including who gets to be inside of it at any given point. 

>Its teaching that trauma of birth is always so much lighter than the trauma of slaughtering your own child in your womb. 

Let me guess, you’ve never been through pregnancy and birth? I would say an abortion at 8 weeks is significantly less physically traumatising than giving birth to a full term foetus which has a 90% chance of genital tearing in first births and a 30% rate of c section which is a major abdominal surgery. By comparison, passing an 8 week embryo is a whole lot easier and less physically traumatising. We also know that a majority of women do not regret their abortions at all, even 5 years after having the abortion, showing that abortion is often not even mentally traumatising. We also know that many, many women report significant birth trauma and many will opt to not have any more children based on a previous horrific experience of birth. 

>And when you tell children about how the right thing and the Law should be is that you never you don’t ever murder your child like its your little play thing and to respect the sanctity of life which every human has will only progress society.

No one sees a ZEF as their ‘little play thing’ - that is a ridiculous claim to make. 

If every human has the sanctity of life that means you don’t believe in lethal self defence right? It means you don’t believe in any war or the death penalty or anything where another human dies, right?
	 comment 45: >Well its that they learn they don’t have the right to murder the child in the womb because they desire it, its saying that 

But "the womb" is a living independent person with reason and conscience, even if you dehumanise her to one of her internal organs. No one thinks abortion is murder. And people don't have abortions because they "desire murder": they have abortions either because some man engendered an unwanted pregnancy, or something has gone wrong with a wanted pregnancy. Prolifers may not like to understand these facts, but they're all true.  


>Its teaching that the consent of this begins at sex, its teaching that violations of human rights via slaughter of the fetus is not okay

And do you believe prolifer men  need to take responsibility for their consent in engendering an unwanted pregnancy which will then be aborted, by always using a condom every time or else not ejaculating inside a woman's  vagina and so not causing an abortion?

	 comment 52: >its saying that Morality is defined by an objective, a Creator who is above us its using logic with morals

Believing in morality by a creator at its core is morality by opinion.  

There is no appreciable difference. You still have to use your opinion to 1) decide a creator is real 2) decide which creator of the 5000+ that people have believed in is the real one(if you believe in just one) 3) decide which belief system and which sect and which dogma you to believe to be true and will follow 4) actually follow those beliefs (how many religious leaders have gone against their beliefs for example and abused others, including children).
	 comment 53: > Well its that they learn they don’t have the right to murder the child in the womb because they desire it

Yes, exactly. They learn that what you just said is fallacious PL propaganda, and that abortion has absolutely no relation to "murdering children." And from there, it is easy to understand that they *do* have the right to terminate a pregnancy because they desire it.

> Its teaching that the consent of this begins at sex

Yes, consent for sex begins and ends with sex. Consent to pregnancy is wholly separate, and the use of one's own body by another human can be always be denied.

> Its teaching that trauma of birth is always so much lighter than the trauma of slaughtering your own child in your womb

When that "other human being" is inside their body, yes, they do. One has the right to self-defense, and does not need to be literally on the verge of death to enact this right. The ZEF's unwanted presence in her body alone constitutes sufficient grounds for removal.

Ahh so according to your logic, I can't remove my rapist off me or make choices regarding their body unless I'm actively being killed by them. And considering that the majority of rapes are non fatal, by your logic, rape victims just have to let themselves get raped, right?

But also. How fucking pathetic that the bar is so low that it's *death*? Just say you don't respect AFABs, that's less insulting that this shit.

>THIS IS WHAT I'D SAY TO THOSE 6 YEAR OLDS.

If that's the case, let's fucking hope you're never in a room with 6 year olds.

	comment 1: Its not normal.
	 comment 2: I hate this
We had a library in grade school when we were small children that formally used to be a public library. I seen this book called abortion or something and I guess I was just curious to what it meant and the principal said the book was not suitable (They forgot to remove a lot of books from the shelves) and the book was seized. So I read national geography for kids. Or any other normal educational children's book.

Post 3: The Abortion Pill is So Dangerous for Women That ER Visits Have Skyrocketed 500% - LifeNews.com
	comment 1: Mifepristone = thalidomide
	comment 2: It's really not dangerous.  It causes discomfort and pain from cramping.  Some people find it scary and go to the ER because they weren't educated about what to expect.  People go to the ER for the common cold.  Making more people more reliant on these drugs rather than allowing for a procedure will cause ER visits to increase.
	comment 3: This is completely out of context, and even in accurate. They visit after hours care centers, if their bleeding is heavier than they expected. This would be a normal result of having a procedure done at home rather than in a clinic setting.

No, let’s talk about letting women nearly died before you give them life-saving care. Fucking Hypocrites.

Post 6: Waltham Company Offering Up To 20 Weeks Of Paid Abortion Leave To Both Women and Men - NewBostonPost
	comment 1: I can do better: I'd gladly offer infinite unpaid leave.
	comment 2: >*However, if the pregnancy loss — including an elective abortion — happens after 20 weeks, it says that “our standard parental leave applies.”*

Well, yeah.  Abortions after twenty weeks are often abortions on wanted pregnancies, where something has gone wrong.  It makes sense that they'd feel that grieving parents would need that same time to cope and recover, and would want to avoid making them jump through hoops to validate that their pregnancy loss was due to fetal or maternal indication.

Remember- only 1.3% of all abortions take place after 20 weeks, which means that this company's policy does not apply to the vast majority of abortions.

Post 6: Pro choicers please answer this question.
	comment 1: Ectopic pregnancies, rape, incest, babies that are genetically so damaged that they will never be able to actually live, etc etc. With laws being passed women literally have to become septic before it’s their life before the “baby’s” even when the fetus was nonviable from the start. It puts womens lives at risk and protects no one. For every first world country that has protected abortion rights we see a rise in overall standards for that country. In third would countries where abortion is banned it happens anyway because people who become pregnant who do not want to be pregnant will abort - safely or not. It’s sheer statistics and medicine. Not to mention most of these abortions are happened before the fetus even has the synapses to process any type of pain, it’s quite literally less quantifiably alive than a plant which sustains its own life function. Finally, you say a simple implant - implants absolutely do not work for everyone. The arm implant has huge risks for getting into circulation and killing you, I’ve literally had friends who had to be rushed to the ER. Not to mention the scar tissue left behind and the fact that the hormones affect everyone differently. As for IUDs they are incredibly painful, women often experience different periods and discomfort. The copper one exponentially increases your period and there have been several medical complications with them throughout time. The hormonal ones back to square one - sometimes they make you feel great sometimes the hormones quite literally can send you into a deep depression, kill your libido, change your skin texture, acne, moods, bloating, weight gain, etc etc. Not to mention a lot of times you can feel the strings during sex and can literally accidentally pull it out. Do some real research on birth control and how it actually affects people. It’s extremely personal because hormones affect everyone very differently. I literally started a birth control that made me sweat uncontrollably at night and have greasy hair 24/7, imagine that’s what’s stuck in your body? It’s a lot more than here’s an implant your good. And then finally you say that the fetus is a human being - is it?? The definition of life at conception quite literally means that organic matter has cellular life - by your definition you are a murderer because any plant or animal you eat is technically life by this definition. It does not actually signify real life. If you actually look at human development and the amount of fertilized eggs that never actually become humans you’d have a different perspective. Not to mention you should have serious issues with the literally thousands of fertilized eggs in fertility centers around the world. Are these Han Solo frozen people? Or are they just fertilized eggs? The problem you actually have is with the idea of abortion because you have a skewed moral view of what is right. What is right, is protecting the life and body of the woman who is living life. She is alive, she’s already guaranteed life. The conceptus could be lost at quite literally any moment, not to mention birth control just skips the implantation part a lot of the time, sending your precious fertilized eggs into the toilet, no more important than the other cells I shed each month. Abortion merely separates the mothers life support to a fetus that does not live or survive on its own, it’s not alive in its own right at all. It’s like a lamp plugged into the wall, it doesn’t inherently have electricity but it uses it while plugged in.
	 comment 2: I hear you about the rare instances in which abortion could seem more acceptable. However most abortions occur simply because a woman doesn’t want to have a baby which I just don’t see how that’s justifiable. Because you don’t want to give up 9 months of your time for a pregnancy you can just kill the baby? You deliver a baby no matter what - dead or alive. The implant is 99% effective, the pills are effective and condoms are effective when used properly. Women that aren’t using these options and are actively having unprotected sex that seek abortions just gives me the ick. Put aside all of those rare cases that you mentioned even though they do happen I agree with that. Do you still think it’s ok if a woman is having unprotected sex willingly and having multiple abortions as a form of birth control? I don’t see how that’s okay at all. I’m thinking about the innocent person created because of the sexual act, this person is still a person no matter how many people try to claim that it’s not. All oppressed groups in history were treated like nothing that could be exterminated such as Jewish people during the holocaust but then people recognized that was not right because they are people. Fetuses are people that have autonomy over their body and nobody has the right to kill them. Even if you were in your mothers womb temporarily she still didn’t have the right to kill you.
	 comment 3: Incorrect ectopic pregnancy is covered under healthcare. Hormones are the same as a period. So a 9 month old couldn't live or survive on its own? Should they be murdered?
	comment 4: I don't want to debate you and I am not really a strong pro-choice person, although I do think abortion should be legal, with what restrictions, I do not know.  Defining a fertilized human egg as a "human" does not work for me.  Obviously, the longer a pregnancy goes on the more human-like the fetus becomes. Barring any other factors, my dissatisfaction at an abortion grows the further along the pregnancy proceeds.  Unfortunately, there are always other factors of varying degrees of depth, impact and importance.  

One thing I believe to be true is that the abortion topic is not black and white, it is not straight-forward and easy.  Do some women make the choice nonchalantly? Probably.  But i suspect there are many for whom it is an excruciating decision. Who is right?

For me, all I can say is that if I were a woman I surely would not think it was anyone else's business what I do with my body.  It would be my decision and mine alone.  Afterwards, I would have to deal with all of the facets of the aftermath.  I am quite certain no one escapes from an emotional deluge with this act.
	 comment 5: Defining a fetus as “human” doesnt work for you because you are not seeing them as image bearers of God. It will never “work” for you until you stop looking at all humans, regardless of the developmental stage they’re in, through the lens of culture and the world, and start seeing humans the way the Lord Jesus Christ sees them.
	 comment 6: >Do some women make the choice nonchalantly? Probably. But i suspect there are many for whom it is an excruciating decision. Who is right?

Why would the feeling of the women make it right or wrong? They are either both right or both wrong. Feelings don't matter.


>Defining a fertilized human egg as a "human" does not work for me.

As long as you acknowledge your going against the science here.


>if I were a woman I surely would not think it was anyone else's business what I do with my body.

The argument is that the woman is making a decision regarding another body. Why does someone get to decide to kill someone else because they are an inconvenience?
	 comment 7: The thing is the fetus has its own body...
	comment 8: IUD has a failure rate, sterilization has a failure rate. Every single thing has a failure rate. So what about those 1%, of IUD failure, or even sterilization? Just get no options? 

>Abortion is the killing of a human being, you can try to spin it in a way that makes it seem justifiable but we all know that a fetus means human baby and that a “clump of cells” is also a human just at a different stage in life.

Yes abortion is the ending of a pregnancy, it's not a baby yet but has the potential of becoming a baby. I don't like the clump of cells argument, but I won't call an 8 week pregnancy a baby either, because there is no baby yet, you can't deliver at 8 weeks and have a baby. 

>I’ve never heard a good argument in favor of abortion, please TRY to debate me on this

It's a woman's body to begin with, why can't she have a choice on what she can endure or not? She made the pregnancy, why can't she terminate it, if she sees fit? Why does it have to be justified to anyone but her?
	 comment 9: [deleted]
	comment 10: Simple, have in tact removal and freeze for when the medical solution to continue them as adopted implants. Can't claim we won't be able, even from regular frozen, life forms wake and are capable of living multiple millions of years pending on what so you're just pressing pause on their frame of perspective existence.
	comment 11: Because I don't want a 9 year old who was raped by her dad to give birth... I don't want a child to grow up knowing they were unwanted, I don't want a child to grow up in an abusive house, I don't want kids to be born with sever disabilities, I don't want to force woman to go through the horrors of pregnancy and the after math, I don't want woman to be forced to get a painful birth control what messes with her hormones and can cause irreversible damages, I don't want woman with life threatening pregnancies to die, I don't want kids to kill themselves because they know they aren't loved, I don't want parents killing themselves because they don't want a baby, I don't want woman to get fired because they got pregnant unexpectedly. 

Why do you want someone to go through all of that? The featus doesn't have an awareness or thoughts. It doesn't know what's going on. Why would you put a human being over some cells that are gone because a human being eventually?
	comment 12: You… said it yourself. It’s 99% effective. Not 100%
	comment 13: if you don’t want to listen to reason in choice, nor the fact of the actual proven anatomical makeup of a fetus, sure. But if you don’t consider rape, coercion, or trauma? Not consider the circumstances of the pregnant woman, and stay ignorant to the fact that not eveuone lives in a developed first world country as i’m so sure you do. Furthermore, i can say surely on my part along with so many other woman that the arm implant is not anywhere in my near future. It’s not just some fifth-gen microchip with no repercussions that temporarily sterilises a womb, it’s not magic. They ensue major hormonal changes to the woman, along with possible side effects of weight gain, mood changes, irregular and painful periods, infection, nausea, painful intercourse- the very reason for an IUD according to you too. Plus, athletes or other females who need their bodies functioning to their full will most likely not risk having an IUD altering their performance. Also, I’m going to go out on a limb and assume you’re first world? Yeah, thought so. IUD insertion is not free where I live either- another first world country. This only begs the questions to areas with less resources or stigma around birth control. I wouldn’t. Enough argument for you?
	comment 14: The same argument could be had about mandatory vasectomies for men versus birth control for women. Vasectomies are reversible, highly effective, have no observable side effects, and are covered by almost all insurance companies. Men are equally as responsible as women for *creating* a baby as they are for *preventing* one. If you want to make the argument that people should prevent pregnancy through birth control rather than abort, that's fine, but the prevention should come from both parties involved and not assume that women should hold all the responsibility. Additionally, there are better ways to prevent people from participating in abortions rather than taking them away entirely. Things like expanded sex education, increased funding for local clinics and planned parenthoods that *provide* the birth control you are talking about, or, crazy concept here, providing women with the resources they need to care for a child in the first place, (i.e. paid maternal leave, free/affordable childcare, or a program such as the one they use in Spain, referred to as the "baby bonus")  are known to be more effective in preventing abortions than its removal of as a whole. Taking away access does not get rid of abortions, it gets rid of *safe* abortions, and I think that it is crazy to frame this argument as if the life of a *potential* human takes precedence over the life of one that is already alive. If you don't like abortions, DONT GET ONE.

	comment 5: This is such a messed up thing to put out into the world. Notice the woman on the table THE PATIENT, is treated by this man as nothing but a mere object? She’s not an object, she was the patient! He doesn’t know if this was a baby from rape or if the pregnancy is viable, clearly he doesn’t even know anything about human gestation or development - a fetus quite literally cannot feel pain, it does not have any capacity to “run away”. This is nothing more than the emotional rhetoric of a clearly uneducated person. The doctor in the room had deemed this medically necessary, notice he didn’t have a sonographer in the room yet and by his own account he had to rush to the operating room? Normal D&E procedures are scheduled. Clearly this man wasn’t a doctor, he didn’t read the chart, and he did not know what was going on. Seeing as he treated the woman as nothing but an incubator for this baby he had no idea if her life was in danger, if the pregnancy was even viable, etc etc. Clearly this was an emergency evacuation though and the doctor had cleared the surgery on an emergency basis for a reason. Notice the doctor is nothing but a villain? They do not talk at all? Usually in any procedure you have everyone involved communicating with each other. You also don’t need to go to the operating room for a D&E usually. Soooo in summation, the facts show that this was an unexpected emergency where the doctors were moving quickly enough that they needed to rush a sonographer over who was not previously privy to the case, he gained no information to asses why the procedure was being performed (especially so quickly), he did not consider the woman on the table as his patient, and he jumped to conclusions without any actual evidence of what was happening.

Right To Life
Post 1: This is the lunacy you support
	comment 1: [“Abortionists would not be prosecuted for administering life-saving treatment to a pregnant woman whose life is at risk, provided they take ‘all possible steps to preserve the life of the unborn child, while preserving the life of the woman.’” ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/news/ohio-introduces-personhood-bill-to-recognize-all-abortions-as-murder) Treating ectopic pregnancies has the primary goal of saving the mother’s life.
	 comment 2: I think OP was more pointing out the bill pushing the idea of extrauterine embryos being able to be extracted and "reimplanted" into the uterus as though that were actually a real medical procedure that existed or was possible to successfully perform.
	 comment 3: Nowhere does this day "treat the life threatening pregnancy. The goal of this bill is to require doctors perform a scientifically impossible procedure. 

It's to criminalize anything short of forced Christian reproduction rules.
	comment 4: Aight so you just completely agree we're not able to agree as we aren't even operating with the same lexicon as you operate with the old English term of infant and I operate with a scientific one. Like, as friendly as I can say, who could even listen to you if you have no means of connecting your language, in essence, your whole argument with anyone and your rhetoric falls entirely. 

Do you spread this as a means of feeling like a good person, because a good person might reflect on their arguments and tactics and adjust them accordingly or simply find some other ship to back.
	comment 5: Well im glad you don't necessarily call people baby murderers, but we are humans on this earth with earthly problems, solutions, desires, and temptation. Many many people follow the Catholic and Christian faith. However, many lived outside of this and if a faith based argument should compel them to act at all differently, shame and patronization is the last thing that could or would reach them. 

The ideal of right to life and the right to choose is one that should be sympathized with, not shamed. Follow your faith. I don't fault that ever, but absolutely be better than that. They aren't cold hearted murderers, they're people seeking an answer that wouldn't see "pray" as a viable option.

If you are unable to connect with someone doing an action you disagree with, do not champion their shaming. That is something that forces the easiest and only action to be doubling down on their action in question. In this example abortion. 

If Right to Life followed any ideology where they wanted "to speak for the unborn child" they would hold up other options that could be better than terminating a pregnancy, should be better than an abortion, and would work so hard to make that accessible to where it made any feasible difference. You'd have more churchgoers that way. 

I don't fault you for that but I absolutely fault the behavior, rhetoric, and common personalities I see in these movements. These arguments will never reach anyone and is the equivalent of drooling in someone's mouth en masse, with zero personal awareness or understanding of sociology. That movement would honestly be twice as effective and bankable if half of you all sat back and worked on yourselves first and learned how to first talk to another person.

	comment 1: My daughter is going through something similar. One of her (now former) friends went off of the pill before her boyfriend departed for the Air Force, she was leaving two weeks later. Long story short, she got pregnant *surprise suprise* and joyfully alerted everyone to the fact that she was going to the slaughterhouse. All she can talk about is what a burden it was, that she can't exercise for a certain amount of time etc. She stood in front of everyone in the group and told them how it wasn't a big deal and that she has a high pain tolerance, to which my daughter responded, "Let's hope that you passed that onto your child, cause that saline injection basically burns the baby to death." They're no longer friends to say the least. The fact that they have no remorse is so f'ing disgusting you wonder if it's a coping mechanism, a low IQ, or the fact that they've been lied to their entire life..."it's just a clump of cells" bs. Hang in there girl you are the next generation to take up the fight!!

	comment 6: The degree of moral relativism, or at least moral selectivity on Reddit is shocking.  I do think people these days are a bit too quick to complain about "shaming", there are certain actions which society should condemn. But I'm not sure "shame" is the right word: I think "conscience" is more important. People should regret abortion (and complicity in it) interiorly because they know they did wrong, not so much because they fear what others will say and think about them.

Maybe her moodiness is really deep down some guilt or regret, she just may not be admitting it yet.

Pro-Life Memes
Post 1: Meta 1.0
	comment 1: This conversation is live for at least a week, but please check out the new rules and flairs to see our current progress.
	comment 2: Just wondering if there can be a rule against pro choice memes or pro-choice ideals since we have very few places safe from their harassment and general contempt
	 comment 3: I updated rule 4 so we can be more strict about it.
	comment 4: Thank you for doing this.
	 comment 5: My pleasure!
	comment 6: Would it be possible to add a link to a bunch of meme templates in the sidebar? And also, any chance we could make a rule that all posts have to be pro-life memes or mod approved? I for my part, strongly support allowing pro-choicers that want to debate us to still be allowed in the sub, as long as they're civil.

I also think it would be worth having a think about how to make rules for posts that relate to other politics as well, and if they count as off-topic. For example, I'm not sure if this one is really a pro-life meme so much as a statement about opposing gun control: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProLifeMemes/comments/v1vq2e/they\_are\_the\_same\_people/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProLifeMemes/comments/v1vq2e/they_are_the_same_people/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and personally would personally like to suggest that we mght need some minor rules on these sorts of things. But at the same time I'm also aware that I could also easily do some spicy memes in a few days about the bombings of Hiroshima/Nagasaki and compare them to abortion, and what I definitely don't want to do is propose a rule  that is either biased against the views I disagree with (except pro-choicers on this space, because it's not their sub, [r/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igWazH_Babw)[AntiLifeMemes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igWazH_Babw) this is not), and obviously, the flipside of not wanting to make a rule against consistent life ethic memes (which I'd like to see more of) is that it would be totally unfair to make one that was biased against conservatives, which is the absolute last thing I'd want the sub to do, and to be clear isn't my proposal.
	 comment 7: >Would it be possible to add a link to a bunch of meme templates in the sidebar?

Done.  It's in a dropdown called Templates at top of sub.

Edit: on reddit mobile, I found it in the Menu at top of sub (after About)

>And also, any chance we could make a rule that all posts have to be pro-life memes or mod approved?

Excellent idea. Have some new rules posted now with this idea.

>I also think it would be worth having a think about how to make rules for posts that relate to other politics as well, and if they count as off-topic.

These are some good thoughts...still looking at what we might do.  I wonder if making up a wiki page to help users navigate some of this nuance, combined with a rule about "being in good taste"... maybe that's too vague, but in line with what you said, we might make a meme with a strong message, and it becomes more a message about the other thing instead.  Or maybe just, "No other politics..." as a rule, lightly enforced.

Post 4: regrets
	comment 1: Plenty of mothers regret having kids. They still made the ethical choice to not abort them and give them a chance at life.
	comment 2: The first part is very very wishful pro-life thinking. In no particular order, threee links:

[https://macleans.ca/regretful-mothers/](https://macleans.ca/regretful-mothers/)

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294566/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294566/)

[https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/why-parents-regret-children/619931/](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/why-parents-regret-children/619931/)

You can think abortion is always the wrong choice while acknowledging that some people do regret having children, or heck, even without wanting children yourself. All you need to be pro-life (i.e, correct on abortion) is just to think abortion is killing a child and something the law should prohibit.
	 comment 3: Also, in addition to the first part being wrong, it's damaging to arguments against abortion. If you are arguing with someone and introduce an easily disproven falsifiable claim, it makes it easier for people to dismiss the arguments as unrealistic or fanciful.

There is no use in being dishonest about how hard being a parent is. It's really hard, and there are elements of it that are very unpleasant. Things like:

- Getting no sleep for years  
- Having to do literally everything to care for your kids  
- Loss of intimacy, or at least much more difficult to maintain intimacy with your partner  
- No privacy  
- Increased expenses (I don't buy the numbers that people throw around, but kids do add expense)  
- Health issues that could crop up, either with you or the kids  

Things like that. It's messy being a parent. I still love my kids and would not trade them for anything. It also means that I have to solve the problems they introduce into my life.

And regardless of what problems they introduce; they have the right to live.

Post 6: WHICH AOC IS WORSE?
	comment 1: Abortion of Convenience. I mostly like AOC, other than her awful views on abortion, though been a bit disappointed with her on foreign policy recently when it came to Ukraine, or making excuses for Biden's border policy (it was wrong when Trump did it, it's still wrong). 

AOC thinks abortion should be legal and sadly votes that way, but not all her ideas are bad (some are honestly great) and I think her overall policy would substantially reduce abortion demand despite the fact she would increase access (which also increase abortion rates). Abortion just results in a dead baby and has zero redemming qualities, and typically leaves the person who has one being $400 or more poorer, so it's not even really helping them economically either.

However, farmed animals need a lot of grain, water etc. Between that and the amount of land needed for cattle/meat farming, eating meat actually results in the consumption of more plants than just eating the plants.

	comment 12: However I have my doubts on if it can work. As much as I wish It could i think it cannot mostly because of how difficult it is to be vegan and how growing crops hurts and kills animals too. Although I would like to have my mind changed.

	comment 1: Rationally, I understand the reasons behind it, like a correlation between veganism, left-wing views and being pro-abortion, or the fact that some environmentalists have negative attitude towards having children, which results in an overlap between vegans and antinatalists... But it's still weird
	 comment 2: Ya I can see the reasoning, but you’d think people who are smart enough to be pro life or vegan in this world (since it’s all not the default in our society) would think things through enough to see outside of party lines
	comment 3: I think many pro-lifers have this view due to religious indoctrination, the belief that human life specifically is sacred in all it's forms, even superior to all other life forms. This is why you have almost an anti-vegan standpoint in some right-wing pro-lifers.

I came to an understanding of being pro-life only because I view life and causing suffering on all pain feeling life forms as undesirable and I do everything in my power and sphere of influence to not be a part of it.
	 comment 4: Ya that would make sense about the religious indoctrination part. They can be so annoying when they are strongly anti abortion but say God made animals for people to eat
	 comment 5: I am intrigued by your support of pro-life because you're against causing suffering on life forms that feel pain, and I can understand this view much better than a purely religious one.
I am curious though as to how you balance this against the suffering the person would feel when they don't want to be pregnant and must continue the pregnancy against their will.

Post 6: Pro life vegan video
	comment 1: That's a nice video!

I do think we should be more focused on the fact that there's a difference between sentient and non-sentient species, rather than on the exact moment when pre-born children gain consciousness.  Some scientists argue that it's possible that they start to feel pain after the 1st trimester, but it still doesn't mean we should be ok with early-term abortions. A human being even at the very beginning of their life isn't equivalent to a plant, because a plant will never be able to gain consciousness. 

I've seen people arguing that painlessly killing an animal is morally fine, because if there's no pain and no fear, then it's "humane". But, honestly, if two people wanted to kill me, disagreeing only on whether it should be done while I'm asleep or not, I wouldn't see much difference between them. And I'd rather experience pain to save my life then die without pain.

Most people have to agree, at least to a degree, that future capacities matter. I mean, some people who eat animals justify it by saying that human intelligence is superior. However, they'll have to add that it's still not ok to kill a newborn baby, even though they're currently only as intelligent as some non-human animals. Why? Because they'll gain the necessary level of intelligence in future.

And while I disagree with those people on what level of intelligence should be enough to value life, valuing future abilities totally makes sence, since by killing people we deprive them of their future, not their past.

	 comment 2: Right? And the report has something like 64 issues in America the UN is urging them to address. I'd be curious to know what the reports for other nations look like.
	comment 3: I am concerned that the ERA doesn't specifically address abortion, and may not be enough on it's own.  This is the text:  

>Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by  
 the United States or by any State on account of sex.

As long as pro-choice activists believe that life begins at conception (a concept that makes no sense, since about 25-30% of fertilized never initiate a pregnancy or pass out in the next menses, often without the woman being aware), they will continue to consider any abortion as murder and fight against it.  I completely agree we need to pass the ERA, but I think we also need specific language in a law explicitly referencing the ERA and based on the ERA that legalizes abortion completely, and that avoids the unnecessary regulations that were set up to try to force clinics to close.   It should also include language that sets guidelines for "pregnancy centers" and for demonstrators.  There should be legal requirements for how far away from the building they must be, how loud they may be, and that they are not entitled to touch, impede, or scream at individuals entering or leaving the building, just as we do for polling places during elections.  Finally, every state should be required to continue collecting data regarding maternal mortality and morbidity.  Some states - I'm looking at you, Idaho! - stopped collecting it soon after the Dobbs decision, because they didn't want anyone to know that MM&M would increase when abortion became unavailable.

	comment 4: That's probably not gonna happen because then you'd have to investigate miscarriages which will put women off getting pregnant to begin with, since miscarriages are very common. No point if you'll just end up in the dock later down the line is there.
	 comment 5: I suspect he’ll follow Idaho’s example - simply eliminate the state’s Maternal Mortality and Morbidity committee.  If you don’t count the deaths, you don’t have to do anything to avoid them, amirite?
	comment 6: Ok. Looks like DeSatanis has a running mate.
	comment 7: Well, if this doesn’t show how evil these people truly are, I don’t know what will. 

I know they don’t care about the women, but to withhold drinking water from the men and children in Orleans parish?

They might want to control themselves, because if the pro life crowd keeps doing stuff like this, it’s going to become harder and harder to ignore their psychotic ways.
	comment 8: What dies water and abortion have to do with each other? Somebody get these idiots out.
	comment 9: Let Louisianans deal with him. If he's derelict in his duties to those whom HE SERVES (remember voters, he works for YOU -not the other way around & apparently needs reminding of this fine point), then let him suffer the consequences.

Beyond that, sounds like tourists should stay away, too.

Post 5: Never trust a Republican
	comment 1: Excellent! More ads like this  before the election especially now as Trump is now trying to rebrand as '[moderate'](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/11/donald-trump-abortion-strategy) on abortion . We know he will he will do anything for the support of anti choice voters
	comment 2: Never trust them, even the women. If they win, they’ll definitely pass a national ban outlawing abortion care, and I believe their next goal is birth control.
	comment 3: They said what they had to say to get the seat. Then they took  $$ to do the bidding of the Republicans.
	comment 4: The decision was over turned not on the content but on a legal theory that was used to decide it originally, that has recently been rethought..  it wasn't the content of the case but the legal theory used and cited to decide the case that was changed
	 comment 5: On the surface, yes, but if you read the decision, they clearly manipulated the legal theory to fit what they wanted to happen. Alito’s occasional citations to ways in which abortion is a societal problem are telling. The question apparently asked to Thomas at the beginning of the clip actually seems to get right to the legal theory, since it asked about privacy—and Thomas said he believed privacy was a constitutional right, but *now* his concurrence on Roe is talking about wiping out ALL privacy-right cases in Roe’s line. That’s WAY too big a pivot for it to be mere “rethinking,” even if it has been a few decades since he said that.

That said, yeah, it’s a bit disingenuous to call it “lying” when someone just said Roe was “precedent.” It was, at the time—it didn’t mean they weren’t interested in overruling it. The problem is they usually gave this answer in response to a question at their confirmation hearing about overturning Roe, and they *were about to get away with* saying “it’s precedent” as if that at all answered the question about their intentions. But still, it’s a campaign ad, so I get the need for straightforward language like “lied.”

Post 6: UK. The Abortion Support Network helps abortion seekers. Meet their helpline staff. ( 4 mins)
	comment 1: At least one good thing in the United Kingdom is that abortion laws aren't regulated per city (or state as another famous country), so one government only regulates it, however the government is still a bit conservative with their rejection system.
	 comment 2: We are hoping to change that at the election next year , replace the right wing government with more left wing one . It looks like quite a few anti abortion MPS will lose their seats

Post 7: Graphic Photo of miscarriage. This clump of tissue has more rights then most women 🤙🏻
	comment 1: I had an abortion when I was about 10 weeks.  This was back in the 90s.  They left the tissue in a bowl in a sink with a towel over it.  They stepped out so I could change and they let me know it was there and that I could look at it if I choose.  They said that some women didn't believe it was terminated unless they could see it.  

Anyway, I braced myself for some awful thing and when I saw it I was like, is that it?  I saw worse on any heavy flow period day.
	 comment 2: Yeah I had an ectopic that I terminated that was about 10 weeks along and it was just like a collection of heavy flow, however gross that sounds.
	comment 3: I feel like photos like these should go viral.

[This article from The Guardian ](https://archive.is/DOc73)shows what an actual ten wk pregnancy looks like under a ~~microscope~~  (fixed for zora) It's pretty neat. No sign of "babies" anywhere.

#
	 comment 4: I have sonograms from having my son. You can see a miniature figure by week ten. I had a miscarriage at week 8 and all I saw was a round sac of blood. That being said I’d still have an abortion if I were to get pregnant now and find out at week 10 however bc fuckin hell, absolutely not.
	 comment 5: This is not pictures of pregnancy under a microscope. This is a collection of pictures of all of the pregnancy tissue as it appears to the naked eye after being rinsed off.
	 comment 6: That’s strange… I miscarried at what I was told was 10 weeks and the fetus was fully formed. Just teeny tiny. Eyes, arms, paddle like hands.
	comment 7: looks like something that comes out of my nose after I plug it with a tissue to stop it from bleeding
	 comment 8: The best description 🤣
	comment 9: Yeah, when I experienced mine, I kind of thought it would be funny to bring this into a pro-life senators office and say “a murders been committed! This blood clot here on this piece of toilet paper, put it inside you and grow it for an additional 32 weeks and see how you can save a life because you’re pro life after all!”

I guess I’m a little insensitive, but a blood clot is a blood clot. I majored in biology, I see the world from the scientific perspective, and this is not a child or a life yes
	 comment 10: I'd have paid to watch a video of that interaction with the senator.
	comment 11: This just makes me depressed that people care more about protecting that than the people already born.
	 comment 12: It's really messed up that this is worth all the atrocities Republican politicians commit. All the blackmail they use this for in the game of politics.
	 comment 13: If it makes you feel better lots of people don’t actually care to protect that. Otherwise we would see the US mass expansion of prenatal care availability and post natal care to deal with our horrible infant and maternal mortality rates.
	 comment 14: In reality they care more about that than protecting the "women" already born. Not just people- women. We are still fighting for basic rights that most white men have always enjoyed in this country. They have the right to wield a gun and shoot someone if they feel threatened- stand your ground laws- while we still don't have the right of control over our health and our own bodies.
	comment 15: May I ask how far along this is? It looks like the alien from those alien baby eggs that were SO popular in the 1990s!
	 comment 16: Probably between 8 and 10 weeks, you only see it at like 8 weeks
	 comment 17: >alien baby eggs that were SO popular in the 1990s!

Holy shit the resemblance is pretty spot on
	comment 18: That is nothing really, only prolifers are doing exaggerations everywhere about "killing a child", because it isn't a child, it is most a red/grey meat ball turning shape even without the skin colour formed.
	comment 19: Detail that it has only rights when it's a fetus, when it forms into a baby and it's born,  people no long care about it
	comment 20: I spent a very silly few hours last weekend daring a pro lifer on here to find a photo - not an illustration, an actual photo - of this. Best he could do was a premie wanted baby.

I'd love to swap the photos of healthy six month olds on pro life billboards with the actual photos of what these look like on average.
	comment 21: I have menorhaggia, my average period rivals that 😭

The other day I had a nosebleed but the water was off temporarily so I just bled onto the floor while very confused on what to do. The resulting coagulation looked exactly like that, with the slightly whiter vaguely baby shaped thing and all.
	comment 22: When I was in my 20s, there was a pro-choice film, *Abortion for Survival*. They showed the results of an abortion around seven, eight weeks. It looked like grainy blood.
	comment 23: Yeah that just looks like a few of my periods. Maybe that's why cismen just can't wrap their heads around these concepts.
	comment 24: I TNRed a feral cat in July, and she had to have an abortion.  She has more reproductive rights than I currently do.
	comment 25: Fuck Republicans and their supporters for bullshit taking away healthcare from women.
	comment 26: Remember kids, an undeveloped fetus an guns have more rights then poc, women, and trans people
	comment 27: This is an image that everyone should see. I wonder if it could get some people that are "on the fence" to agree this is not life.  

Is it OK to save this photo to use as a reference in future abortion discussions? (Asking in case it's your personal photo)
	 comment 28: Not personal photo. feel free to save
	comment 29: This is where the prolife propaganda is so viscous.   The picture the show are not these.  When I saw the guardian 10 week pictures,  I realized that they have been scamming women for a long time.   That a clump of cell was just about it.   I looked at the miscarriage group, same thing.  I turns out I dont have a strong stomach.  No babies found.     This is why if your of reproductive age having a spare mtp or two isnt a bad idea.    They are available.    I have been able to find them as low as 10 for $50 with some websites.  From a know planc Vendor $50.   But I understand there may be something else in the works for lower prices there for ladies who want to be prepared.
	comment 30: I am vehemently pro-choice so know that when I say- and then add onto this how incredibly fucked up our family court systems is! If you know you know they don’t give a damn about kids. It’s all about parental rights, you have to be EGREGIOUS to loose custody of your children. Our services, standards, and care for kids should be so much higher. Don’t even get me started on education….
	comment 31: So do corpses
	comment 32: That looks like an average period clot
	comment 33: why I'm getting my tubes tied ASAP, luckily I'm wlw so I dont have to worry about accidents and if I did change my mind I'd rather adopt
	comment 34: the fact that women are forced to keep this and terminating it is “murder” 😞
	comment 35: Glad I looked! It really just looks like a blood clot, no fully formed humans here!
	comment 36: Than* most women
	comment 37: Genuine question. How can you tell that’s a fetus? I had a glob similar to that fall out of me a few years ago and I thought it was possibly a very early miscarriage but it was impossible to tell. Tho if this fell out of me I feel like I would’ve been equally unsure

Post 8: Heartbreaking reality of the GOP States of America
	comment 1: Seems weird even for them. A lot of them are all for women returning to the kitchen making sandwiches and popping out kids every nine months, do they really want to scare them off of that with the threat of prison time if a very common bodily function that unfortunately occurs during pregnancy, outside of the person's control, happens? Seems dumb even for them but then weirder things have happened. Maybe they'll go full circle and ban pregnancy next, who knows.
	 comment 2: It's a way to charge the "wrong" (unmarried, minority) women with felonies and strip them of their right to vote.
	 comment 3: > Seems dumb even for them

there is no low they cannot sink to
	comment 4: apparently, the fetus had already passed too, she went to the hospital 2x but they sent her to have a miscarriage at home. This law is stupid, and the fact that women especially black women will be more affected by these laws is disheartening.
	comment 5: This is stupid. If Ohio wasn’t a state run by dumbass backwards hillbillies, this woman would have had a D&C at the hospital, which is the medical care she needed.

	comment 2: Hey there. I'm sorry you're so scared. This sub has a collection of [second-trimester procedure stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/collection/ab64e640-0755-4784-b968-732ee4fa66d3/) that I think will be really helpful in letting you know what you can expect.

When you mention being somewhat awake, I think you're referring to moderate sedation. It's not fully going under. However, it can make you feel so relaxed that you don't have memory of the procedure. The stories I linked to should give you an idea of what that's like.

If you jump ahead to the D&E section of [this article](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures/what-happens-during-an-in-clinic-abortion), you'll get an idea of the steps involved. Your clinic should also give you an overview.

Abortions can bring up a lot of complicated emotions — especially if the circumstances around them aren't what we want them to be. If your partner isn't treating you well, he doesn't deserve you. It makes a lot of sense that you wouldn't want to be tied to him through a child — and it's a loving decision for the potential child because you know this isn't the world you'd want to bring them into.

Something that a lot of people don't realize is that abortion procedures aren't surgeries. That term is commonly used, but there's no cutting or stitching. It's a very safe process.

If you're comfortable sharing what country you're in, I'd be happy to offer some resources that might help as you process what's happening. Things will get better with time. You're making the best decision you can for your life and situation. I think that may become more clear when you have some distance from how challenging this has been.

Wishing you the best. <3
	 comment 3: Thank you so much crying while reading this I’m in USA Arizona but traveling to Las Vegas due to the ban thank you for taking the time to reply to me .🥹
	comment 4: I’m in the same boat right now. I’m getting mine tomorrow and very scared. I was told how the two day procedure would go but turns out mine might be one day and very different (I have to go out to state because I can’t get in anywhere in my state right now). 

Not exactly what you’re asking but If you haven’t already had a consultation and the state you’re going to doesn’t require them, I recommend calling the actual clinic you’ll be going to and asking to talk to a nurse who assists with the procedures. I’ve called my clinic 3 times to ask questions and the last time I talked to the nurse, I had her walk me through each possibility of how the procedure could go, I asked what pain and anxiety management is offered for EACH step not just the procedure itself. It’s not going to fill the knowledge of how other people experienced the procedure, but it’s info I wanted to have. 

I told her how nervous I am and why I’m asking so many questions. I ended up in tears on the phone with her for reasons other than just nerves (we are tfmr) and she reassured me she treats every patient like they’re her daughter and everyone there will be supporting me. It brought me a lot of comfort and I hope wherever you’re going, you’re treated with the best care and understanding. We’ll get through this!

	comment 5: I had a terrible SA experience too. I also took the pills instead of IV medication. The sedation they gave me did nothing but made me confused. It was supposed to partially block the memories of the procedure from sticking and that sure didn’t work. The entire thing is burned in my memory. I had a lot of pain, and I also had a small hemorrhage during the procedure that left me feeling lightheaded and ill afterward.
	 comment 6: I am so sorry you went through that. It’s so hard especially since the memory is so fresh. I hope it fades quickly for you and I.
	comment 7: I had a SA on dec. 1st and I didn’t take any pills and I wasn’t connected to an IV or anything. He just stuck a needle in my arm and injected it. The pain was HORRIBLE. I was somewhat “out of it”, but I felt the pain. It’s like my insides were being ripped out. I was crying and begging the nurse to ask the doctor to take a break and she said “we can’t stop, we have to keep going.” I felt like it was never going to end. I don’t remember her holding my hand either. Horrible experience. I’m sorry you experienced something similar:(

	comment 2: I am very sorry you’re going through this. Have you contacted the clinic to see if they can get you another copy? It is part of your medical record with them.
	 comment 3: I was thinking about that, but didn’t know if it was entirely possible. I’ll try to reach out to them, thank you!!
	comment 4: I’m so sorry you can’t find your ultrasound. You’re not silly. I would be devastated if I lost the ultrasound of the baby I aborted years ago. I struggled for a very long time with what I’d done. The only thing that has helped is actually acting like it was my baby. I framed the ultrasound picture, I gave them a name. I have a baby now, but in a meaningful way I consider myself to have already been a mother because of this previous pregnancy and abortion. You’re allowed to feel this way, and you’re allowed to grieve. I would reach out to the clinic and see if you can get another copy. I hope you find it.
	 comment 5: Thank you so much, I cried at this because you’re right, it is my baby. Thank you.
	comment 6: I’m really sorry. You didn’t do anything wrong and have a right to grieve on your own terms.
	 comment 7: Thank you, I appreciate this comment a lot. I always think about those mothers who wanted to keep their babies and lost them. I need to remind myself that their experience is their own just like mine. Thank you so much, I’m glad I found this sub.
	comment 8: I am so so sorry you’re feeling this pain, because I understand and feel it all and know how bad it hurts. I’ve had multiple abortions, all pretty different experiences, but I do feel like I lost a child. The love and connection that you can feel when you’re pregnant, no matter how long or what circumstances, is incredible. Even though I wasn’t ready to be a mom to a baby physically here, I just have to remind myself what that inkling of motherhood felt like. That completely pure love for someone else who doesn’t exist outside of your body is indescribable, and it made me so full of joy but also pain and heartbreak. You have every right to grieve this loss, because it is something you lost, whether you chose it or not. Your feelings are legitimate and from what I’ve read, it seems you made your choice because you experienced that crazy love and did what was best. Honestly, you wouldn’t tell someone else they can’t grieve someone they loved and lost, so don’t let those voices get in your brain. The anti abortion propaganda is awful and I think the reason we have reservations about grieving in the first place. It’s hard to give yourself permission to feel but I promise it is so much better once you do. I named my first baby and talk about him happily with his dad on his due date and if something makes us think of him. He’s the only one that has 100% understood and validated that feeling for me, and being able to talk about who our son would be or the connection we felt hurts, but it feels so fucking good to do so. I wouldn’t wish this pain that we feel on anybody, but I consider myself lucky to get a glimpse of what it’ll feels like to become a mom to a baby here with me.
	 comment 9: I do want to add not everyone feels like this, and that’s okay! Sometimes it is plainly just a medical procedure and not emotional, and that’s alright too.
	comment 10: Hey honey. I keep the ultra sound of my aborted baby in my car and look at when ever I need reminder to keep going, keep pushing through hard times, to remember the sacrifices I made in order to be the woman and mother I m determined to become. I lost mine once too, and I soo panicked and broke down!
I contacted the clinic and they had it on my file. The scanned it and sent it to me, hopefully your unites sound clinic will be able to do the same.
 Don’t be hard one yourself. Some women feel empowered, or relief or emboldened by their choice, and others spend the rest of their lives questioning themselves 
But believe me, you will be ok. You may always feel sadness, or grief doesn’t disappear (and yes it is grief, even if you made a choice it is grief) 
But you will get aspects of your life back. You will find a sense of purpose and motivation again. You will have new experiences where you feel joy, and you’ll know that you’ve made the right decision.
You will be a mother one day, in the right time on your terms when you are ready and excited. You will heal ❤️
	 comment 11: I also have my pregnancy test in a safe box and it’s been years ❤️
	comment 12: I understand. I keep mine in a box. I keep it with the vitamins and stuff I took while I was pregnant and my positive test and a teeny tiny baby doll roughly the same size as my Skylar was. I named my baby. I keep my baby close to my heart. It would tear me up if something happened to my picture. I rarely look at it just so nothing happens to it. I have thought about taking a Polaroid picture of the ultrasound so I can have like a little version I can carry with me. I’m glad you don’t regret your decision. The regret and guilt have been eating me alive for months. Reading your post actually helped me feel a little better tho. Knowing I’m not the only one who loved my baby and saw them as my baby. I get really tired of people reminding me that it wasn’t a baby or a person or whatever. Reminding me of all the things they weren’t to them or to the world. My baby was a person to me tho. My baby was my best friend. Idk if it will ever make sense to anyone else. I really hope you find your picture.
	comment 13: Not silly at all. Everything about the decision can be complex regardless of your circumstances for choosing abortion. Even if you were so sure and still think it was the right thing. Any feelings of sadness you have doesn’t mean it wasn’t the right choice and it doesn’t mean your current feelings aren’t valid. I’m sure history of religious guilt makes it even more complex. 

We all have what if’s throughout life and this is a tough one especially when you do want children someday. It’s okay if people feel no connection to their pregnancy before and after and it’s okay if people feel love and attachment before and after. There’s definitely no right or wrong and definitely no predicting your feelings. 

I’m so sorry you cannot find your pictures and I hope they turn up.

PlannedParenthood
Post 1: Unnecessary trans abdominal ultrasound at Planned Parenthood? (non pregnant)
	comment 1: Do you live in a forced birth state? If so they may be mandated to perform it beforehand.
	 comment 2: But without a full bladder? And for the Pill?!
	comment 3: The only explanation you got was “to make sure of a few things”? That’s not okay. That’s not informed medical consent. Definitely call and complain/find out what that was about. Ultrasounds (or even pelvic exams) are not usually required before getting the pill, just a pregnancy test. Maybe something flagged in your test results so they wanted to double check your uterus, but they should’ve explained that if that was the case.
	comment 4: What is the name of the medication? Some birth controls can cause issues with your reproductive system, vitamin count, etc. For me, my birth control can lead to bone deterioration due to a vitamin D deficiency from the birth control. 

 Some places do ultrasounds to make sure you aren’t pregnant, there aren’t any health concerns within the womb or stomach area in general, etc.

In this case, I’d go and ask what the ultrasound was for and if you could look at your health records with them.
	comment 5: Please elaborate on how the nurse explained what they were going to do. I am confused

Post 2: appointment for hrt
	comment 1: Have you tried calling?
	 comment 2: i tired today but no one ever answered so i wanted to post to see how it worked for others. ill keep trying to call when i can
	comment 3: Your appointment itself would most likely not be able to be a walk in, but you may be able to walk in to schedule (they may tell you you need to call though since sometimes hrt are more complicated to schedule so they may say they don't schedule in person. If you live nearby it doesn't hurt to check)

In terms of not seeing it online, they may either not offer it as an online booking option, they may be currently fully booked, or your specific site may not offer hrt. The only way to know would be to directly ask your PP (calling is usually the easiest although you may have to try a few times if theyre busy)
	comment 4: I waited about 3 months for an opening, I’d check the website a few times a day.
	comment 5: The website (atleast in my expirence) is trash. Like it was impossible to schedule anything ever and I had to check in everyday. I'm not entirely sure why their website is like that. 

But yes you can do walk ins. I've seen people do it multiple times while there. :)

You can walk in, call, or attempt to navigate the website
	 comment 6: The website doesnt even explain anything just says we are here for you call the number its not clear if im supposed to call to make an appointment for hrt or there just isnt any openings or what i need to do.
	comment 7: What are are you from?
	 comment 8: missouri

Post 4: cant get aroused?
	comment 1: I hate to say this, but it sounds a lot like either he doesn't know how to stimulate you while having sex, or you're not sexually aroused by him. Female reproduction isn't as complicated as people think. We need both physical and mental stimulation to get going. If one of those isn't there, then it won't work without help. Try getting a hand held vibrator, use it while he's thrusting. It will help. You can even ask him to use it on you, leave it to him to surprise you, you know? What's most important is communication with each other. Talk about it. Then maybe see a gynecologist, they may have answers. Also, look up the book "for yourself" by Lonnie Barbach PHD. Good luck!
	comment 2: are you aroused by him at all? If not then nothing much will help. Just he thought of your partner should be getitng you aroused. You must answer this to yourself first.

Post 7: IUD replacement denied because I’m on Medicare. Wanting to pay out of pocket
	comment 1: Call planned Parenthood again and see if they have funding help for people who don't have insurance. If they don't have your insurance on file, afaik you can say you have no insurance and they will be none the wiser. 

If you are anywhere near a planned Parenthood great plains location, we have funding for IUDs and nexplanon and I can give you the info for that. 

did some digging:

mirena, Skylar, and kyleena are all manufacturered by Bayer, which seems to offer financial assistance for certain prescriptions, including those. 

[mirena funding assistance](https://www.mirena-us.com/ordering-reimbursement#assistance)

[mirena coverage info](https://www.mirena-us.com/ordering-reimbursement)

[Bayer US Patient Assistance Foundation](https://www.patientassistance.bayer.us/en/find-help) (you can apply for assistance here)

[some more helpful stuff about accessing long acting contraception](https://larcprogram.ucsf.edu/self-pay)

edit: also, IUD and nexplanon recommendations have changed in the past few years. idk if it was different before, but kyleena is good for 5 years according to their website.
	 comment 2: Thank you. I live in WA state. I worry about lying. 😂
	comment 3: This is because physicians who are not contracted with Medicare cannot see Medicare patients out of pocket. This is a system meant to get doctors to be contracted as Medicare providers.
	comment 4: 1) what state do you live in?
2) try this https://www.bedsider.org/where_to_get_it/bcbenefits
	 comment 5: I live in Washington State
	comment 6: The reason why you can’t get covered with Medicare is because there might be government funding that allows people with no insurance to get financial assistance while Medicare-eligible persons can get access to “better” care. 
Look up, “title 10”

Post 8: Brown thick discharge 2 days post IUD
	comment 1: [deleted]
	 comment 2: Ty so much
	 comment 3: Are you a medical expert?
	comment 4: Did you ever get this checked out?
	comment 5: I'm having something like this right now, and I was wondering what this means. Like I'm supposed to be starting my period, and I'm getting something like this but not as watery. It's more like a brown goop, and it reminds me of blood clots or like balls of something. I'm just really confused about what is happening to my body, and I really would like some help. I was wondering if anyone could have a possible answer for me?
	comment 6: This may very likely have been the cleaner! It is a lot like iodine, and a brown discharge is normal. If you reported a history of UTI's, it's even more likely they used this cleaner when inserting your IUD. I would recommend calling about any concerns you have.

Post 9: Yeast infection under breasts ?
	comment 1: Try the spray to powder version of the anti-fungal.  Moisture is not your friend, sometimes the cream just keeps that yeast growing.  Also, hold the girls up and use a hairdryer to make sure that skin is really dry.  Do all this twice a day for about a week.  If it’s still not resolved after that, see a medical professional for something a bit stronger.  One last thought, wash your bras after each wear so you aren’t reintroducing the yeast back to healing skin.  Good luck!
	 comment 2: Thank you for the advice! Would I use something like spray and powder or like just spray like lotrimin for athlete’s foot and then put like unscented baby powder to keep it dry?

Post 10: Help PP billed me for much more than expected
	comment 1: The fees you see online are likely self pay using a sliding scale. Unfortunately insurance carriers co tract a price with providers which is typically much, much higher than private pay. That’s due to the insurance, not PP. I know it doesn’t help now but in the future you can contact your insurance company ahead of time and ask for a billing estimate prior to any treatment.
	comment 2: This is also my first post on reddit if anyone has suggestions of other subreddits that could be helpful I'd appreciate it!
	comment 3: this sounds more like a problem with your insurance, because the billing dept was right, once it’s billed to insurance PP can’t do anything about it anymore.
	 comment 4: But what I don't understand is how they billed me so high in the first place for a service that's on their site says for testing and treatment only costs $50-96. I thought PP was supposed to be affordable / low cost. What does my insurance have to do with billing me almost $700

Post 10: What form of BC should I take?
	comment 1: There’s no way to know how a bc will affect you before taking it. The shot is very effective but it’s not long term because after 2 years there’s a high risk of loss of bone mineral density.
	comment 2: I (20F) have been on the implant and an iud. I hated the implant as it made me bleed almost constantly. I LOVE my iud. I have very light periods and it’s 99.8% effective. Good for 7 years. Definitely recommend it as an option
	 comment 3: Started with some very light bleeding when I got my implant in June (+combo pill for like two weeks) for like 2 weeks, no bleeding ever since, and I feel a lot more stable than on the combo pill. It is a gamble with the implant whether or not you bless. My friend bled on the IUD for 3 months straight when she just got it

	comment 5: I did the shot when I was around your age for the same reason, and liked it a lot! But yes there are concerns about its long term use. I think the implant would also be good for your situation, it’s very effective and nearly foolproof.

I had a bartholin cyst that was there but i have been taking antibiotics to make it go away could it have popped? Or could i be pregnant? Or something else? But i havent had a real regular period since july. Pleasee help
	 comment 2: I'm unsure to be honest with you . I would go to the doctors. To check on your cyst just in case you got a Infection. About your period I don't know because some time I don't come on myself and I'm not on any medication  ...

your cervix called 'borderline changes'.
	comment 3: I haven’t had a period since last August. It has been 10 months since I last experience a period. I’ve gone to a doctor and I was diagnosed with PCOS. After, they suggested I start using birth control to avoid ovarian cancer since the walls of my uterus don’t shed like they should. I said no. I’ve gotten an ultrasound of my uterus done, no scarring; therefore, no signs of cysts. I produce excess hair on my chin, hormonal acne, and have issues with my weight—all of this gave my doctors reason to diagnose me with PCOS; however, I think there might be some other issue going on.
	comment 4: I had leep surgery 4 weeks ago, I waited until then to have sex. It wasn’t painful or uncomfortable, but once I got up I realized I was bleeding a lot (like a heavy period day) and this morning I’m not still bleeding a lot, just a mild water spotting type of blood when I wipe. It doesn’t hurt but it’s a slight ache where I can feel the spot. Is this normal?

Post 5: Life after abortion
	comment 1: First off, I want to say that what you're feeling is valid, and it's okay to have these emotions. Dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath of an abortion, especially in the context of an abusive relationship, can be incredibly challenging.  
  
As for the physical changes you've noticed, it's essential to remember that our bodies can react differently to various experiences, including stress and hormonal changes. It might be a good idea to reach out to a healthcare professional who can offer guidance tailored to your situation. They can address your concerns and explore ways to help you feel better physically.  
  
On the emotional side, healing is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. If you're comfortable, consider talking to friends or family for support. There are also online communities where people share their experiences and provide understanding and advice. It might be helpful to connect with others who have gone through similar situations.  
  
In the meantime, practicing self-care is crucial. Whether it's getting some exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, or simply taking time for activities you enjoy, these small steps can make a difference in how you feel.

Post 7: Hysteroscopy: Can I skip the procedure? Can I refuse to do it? Were there other options?
	comment 1: I would check in with your health insurance (if you have it) who is in network nearby .  And get a second opinion.  Because our medical system is “so much fun” like that, in network/out of network, etc
	 comment 2: Yes, I've done inquiring on my healthcard and the only solution that I'm thinking right now is to wait for the fund renewal of my healthcard. Even if so, I still have to prepare an extra in case they will not cover all of it and it will be depleted once I used it on my procedure. 

Getting a second opinion is also my option. I only hope that the next doctor will have another suggestion aside from hysteroscopy. :(

Post 10: Late periods and why? Should I worry?
	comment 1: I would talk to your primary care doc and/or ONGYN about this.  And be prepared to tell them about any changes in your life (meds prescribed or otherwise, significant change in weight, etc etc etc). We of the internet can comment on our own experiences and what was true of us, but since we don’t know you or anything about you, we cannot say what is or is not true about you.  Yeah, it could be something crazy and scary like cancer, but it could also be that you went and lost 25 lbs and are now ideal weight and your body is just adjusting and it will normalize in a minute. The internet will give you all possible answers and too easy to get paranoid about the one person who has that really rare thing.
	 comment 2: Then what's the point of this group? Womenhealthcare?
	comment 3: Hey there! 

It's completely normal for periods to occasionally be a little off schedule. Stress, changes in diet, and other factors can contribute to a delayed period. Since you're sure you're not pregnant and haven't had any recent changes in lifestyle, it could just be your body reacting to minor fluctuations.  
  
However, if it becomes a recurring issue or if you're feeling concerned, it's always a good idea to check in with your doctor. They can provide personalized advice based on your health history and address any potential underlying causes. Remember, our bodies can be quite sensitive to various factors, and the occasional irregular period is usually nothing to worry about. Take care!

Post 5: How Does Reproductive Justice Intersect With the Black Lives Matter Movement?
	comment 1: Reproductive justice is a term (and vision for the reproductive rights movement) that was built by activist, Loretta Ross. Ross, and other WOC broadly, challenged what white American activists understood as reproductive rights. For white, cishet, often middle class women - repro rights was focused largely on a woman’s right to access safe affordable birth control and abortion. 

Immigrant, indigenous, lesbian, and Black women and trans men often need access to those aspects of repro health, too - but those groups of people with uteruses have historically (and still) need access to their right to have and raise children in safe, sustainable circumstances. WOC have been sterilized against their will. Black women face insanely high mortality rates as do their infant children due to racist discrimination in OB medicine. 

The BLM movement, like Ross’s more comprehensive and intersectional understanding of repro justice, requires racial literacy in praxis. BLM fights to make clear: Black lives are socially and culturally constructed as less valuable in all aspects of American (and even Western) white supremacist societies. And as such, Black lives and experiences are often and deliberately erased - when that understanding intersects with repro justice, those of us committed to both movements must acknowledge and advocate for the very life-or-death and distinct reproductive health needs of Black people with uteruses and their children.

	comment 1: This is a systematic barrier to prevent vulnerable groups from having the choice to terminate known pregnancies early. Guaranteed this “unintentional effect” is very intentional. 

There’s far more expensive or high risk items for theft in Walmart that are not “protected” in this manner. 

Do men having the same trouble accessing shaving razors which are often “protected”? Doubtful. 

Walmart knows what they’re doing.
	 comment 2: Thank you for this. You are absolutely right. Please leave a comment to them. Id love if the media got ahold of this because it is a big deal
	 comment 3: I like to think it's not intentional, but you're probably right. P
	comment 4: This is such a fantastic example of men setting up rules and systems with zero awareness in how other people will experience those rules and systems or that other people may have different needs then they do. Men don't buy pregnancy tests themselves and there is no social mechanism that rewards them for being empathic (why would they need to be empathic? the whole world is set up for them - everyone else should think if their needs!)

Empathy is taught from childhood and reinforced again and again, though the expectations are entirely different for men than for women. It really make me interested in how to build children intentionally to have empathy. It would be so nice to have more men on our side for once! 

Do any of you know or have your children been in school programs tgat effectively taught empathy?

It's a fine sport that's good for cultivating a lot of good personal traits. I think that the American left has done itself a great disservice by focusing so heavily on gun control. It's part of what fucked us over for the rural vote. For my part, I make it known that I have a standing policy of offering gun advice and training to anybody who wants it. As someone with a lot of LGBT and POC friends, I was surprised by how many people wanted to own guns but felt intimidated by the traditional, stereotypical firearms community.

And Hispanics I mean half the countries if you don’t have a gun you’re a target.  Every single Puerto Rican family member I have owns at least one if not many.  That island is big into guns… Mexico is a mix bag but most of them love guns too.  The Hispanics have more in common with the Republicans than the democrats.. very religious, into guns, into holding onto old traditions, I’d say the abortion issue is a mixed bag too.

He pew is clearly trying not to say it but if 14% of all Hispanics say it should be illegal in all cases and as a whole only 8% of all polled say that then that indicates a stronger pro life in that group..  

It’s just sad that these groups take advantage of people not understanding how to read statistics. 

14-8 is a big enough difference that it shows the views of Hispanics can’t be seen as a monolith that there’s clearly needs to be a better division there.
	 comment 8: I always think it's interesting how people tend to forget that modern gun control strategies originated in the efforts to deprive freedmen and immigrants of their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

My deepest apologies for not being able to get to it quickly. For future reference, I am probably not the best moderator to tag if you need something looked at super quickly.

I think it's been awhile since you have been active, but we have gotten stricter on users blocking other users because it affected many users' ability to interact on threads.

I do ask, SayNo' that when you choose to disengage with someone you simply stop engaging with them. If I decided to, I could never speak to you again and even if you offered to send me money, insulted my mother, or gripped my vocal cords with your bare hands, I wouldn't have a conversation with you.

Please next time you decide to disengage (make it now mabye?) just don't respond.

Excuse me, but how tf are their so called "memory issues" my problem? Why is this user being allowed to ignore the rules and the mods requests, interfering with *my* ability to properly engage with other users?


Edit: I felt like this should be addressed as well. In this meta thread, u/Pregnant_Silence claims that *they* blocked *me* due to "bad faith". Hmmmm. Okay yeah let's look at that a bit.


Here, is where *I* told them to move on, to no longer engage with me:


https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/s/Is0LAyNB2r


As *everyone* can see, u/Pregnant_Silence told me that they were going to "move on", as in go away and no longer engage with me. Instead, they *continued* to pester me for another half hour, until getting frustrated and blocking *me*.


How is this behavior being allowed? They told me they were going away, didn't go away, continued to pester me, once they got frustrated *they* blocked me, maliciously, to prevent me from engaging with others (when they could've just, ya know, stopped continuously responding to me), and now they're outright refusing the mods request, refusing to acknowledge the rules (there's a whole damn post on weaponized blocking), and they're complaining here in this thread that I am somehow the "bad faith" user in this exchange.

	comment 21: Hey mods, there really needs to be a policy on y'all reporting users for "report abuse" for reporting your own inappropriate or unprofessional rulings.

Getting a 3 day temp ban from the entire site, probably doled out by the moderator in question, for reporting one moderator comment one time that was weeks old, is an abuse of power. It's also further evidence of the issues your entire user base, PL and PC, often point out and issue complaints about. 

This kind of behavior only serves to deepen the distrust I, and many of my fellow redditors, often vocalize regarding your policies, rulings, and general moderator actions. It's why I won't be posting the name of the moderator, linking the comment, or taking this to mod mail; retaliation is expected.

	comment 24: I have been asked by u/kingacesuited to unblock a user.  Maybe I'm wrong but I do not see anything in the rules against blocking users.  

I think the block feature is essential for this sub in particular.  I do not abuse the block feature (I have fewer than 5 users blocked), but I do use it when I encounter a user that to me seems to be engaging persistently in bad faith.  That way, I do not reply to the same user in the future, igniting another firestorm.  I have a pretty bad memory and would not be able to just remember the usernames of these users absent a block. 

I recognize that blocking a user can create issues for the blocked user's ability to reply to a thread, but this is a side-effect of a legitimate block. 

At a minimum, if there really is a rule against blocking, that should be written down somewhere.
	 comment 25: > At a minimum, if there really is a rule against blocking, that should be written down somewhere.

They [discuss it here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/16cxd4j/special_announcement_new_official_policies_for/)
	comment 26: I've been posting on this sub for a few days now, and I've noticed a couple of trends. They're pretty hard to overlook and I think everyone can largely agree on them.

First, there aren't many pro-life posters, at least compared to pro-choice. Any given thread is about an 85-15 split. This is quite possibly a consequence of the fact that the pro-choicers universally have no regard for rule 4. Every thread I go to I have to unmask the hidden pro-lifer posts because they've all been spammed with downvotes. Every thread, every pro-life post.

I myself in the few days I've posted here have seen just the users from this board alone drop me several hundred karma in that short amount of time. Now, I actually don't care about karma personally, but I know many Redditors live and die on it. 

So then, my question is what's the goal here? Are the pro-choicers attempting to drive out all dissent and make it an echo chamber? You'd find a debate sub is a pretty lonely place with no one to debate. Or is the thought that there will always be some new pro-lifer that sticks around for a few days before they get swept under the brigading and leaves? I suppose I'm proof that that thought has merit. Am I just overthinking it? You see pro-life tag, you have a visceral reaction and downvote automatically, the consequences of driving them all away never even enter your mind?

This is a genuine question to the pro-choicers.
	 comment 27: You can’t lose “several hundred karma” from this subreddit. The limit is -100 karma 

Downvotes and upvotes are not limited to active users. There are never that many active users on this sub at any one time. What you are likely witnessing with large karma swings are lurkers interacting with comments. 

This is the nature of a public debate forum with a voting mechanism in place. Perhaps consider why the public so strongly dislikes your commentary before automatically assuming it is a conspiracy, because I can assure you that it is not the latter.
	 comment 28: > So then, my question is what's the goal here? 

I don't think there is any unified goal. But generally, people are extremely disgusted by PL ideology and the down-voting is just an expression of that revulsion. Most people are not dumb, so they can see straight through all of the lies and hypocrisy, and more importantly, they can see the REAL WORLD EFFECTS of abortion bans. 

You're getting downvoted because you are arguing in favor of forcing a repressive and regressive dogmatic ideology on to actual thinking feeling persons. You're arguing in favor violating women's human rights and robbing them of their human dignity. You're aruging in favor of forcing women to sustain serious physical injury, mental trauma and even death. And when the effects of abortion bans are brought up, PLers consistently brush these issues aside and refuse to take any accountability for the effects their laws have on society. Which is incredibly hypocritical given the prevalence of the "Responsibility Objection." 

It's kind of like if this were a debate over legal slavery in an era when slavery was illegal, and the slave owners were complaining about getting booed for making arguments about why slavery should be legal.

What consequences?
	 comment 29: > This is quite possibly a consequence of the fact that the pro-choicers universally have no regard for rule 4. Every thread I go to I have to unmask the hidden pro-lifer posts because they've all been spammed with downvotes. Every thread, every pro-life post.

I think the evidence hardly supports that pro-choicers “universally have no regard for rule 4” and making blanket claims like this does you no favors. There are for sure PC who downvote contrary to rule 4. In fact I have experienced an exchange with one of the mods where I my comments were downvoted as they responded to me. I have also had a similar experience with a few regular PL users of this sub, my comments are downvoted as they respond. 
This type of downvoting is unfortunate and I wish downvotes were public, but that is outside of our control. What I try to do to counteract the effects of this downvoting is 1) sort comments by new as a default, 2) turn off the default setting of comments collapsing based on votes received, 3) upvote every comment I read. I initially did 3 as a means of keeping track of what I read, but now it is also my small effort to counteract unnecessary downvoting. I encourage others to consider doing the same.
	 comment 30: >there aren't many pro-life posters, at least compared to pro-choice

This is also just what it's like IRL. In terms of posters, the people with more controversial opinions are less likely to post. 

>have no regard for rule 4.

This usually is due to the lurkers. That's expected, if you say something controversial/fucked up/unempathetic, people are more likely to downvote it.

Lol then don't say stupid fucked up shit? It's not that hard. 

>Are the pro-choicers attempting to drive out all dissent and make it an echo chamber?

It's a bit of an echo chamber. I think it's because of PL who do post end up getting tons of responses and engagement and that can get overwhelming. Also, many PL are reluctant to post in the first place. I understand why though, it's not easy to post in a place where your views are questioned and challenged. 

>You see pro-life tag, you have a visceral reaction and downvote automatically, the consequences of driving them all away never even enter your mind?

Can't speak for anyone else, but I've never done this. But there's a good chance a lurker or someone else might feel this way.
	 comment 31: Don't get gaslit. It's not solely on the lurkers.

Many regulars on here regularly downvote every time you post a comment; it'll be on 0 by the time you get to replying, and then will simply tank further down -5, -10, -15. You can always blame this on the lurkers, but it's too much of a coincidence. Even innocent questions get nuked if you have a PL flair.  Rule 4 is not much of a rule. It's an unenforceable suggestion that the majority seem to not follow. 

The goal here for PC is to essentially dunk on PL-ers. They are very comfortable in this echo chamber of a sub, and as a result the standard of debating is low. Many have explicitly said they are immovable in their positions. They just use it as an arena to beat PL over the head with rhetoric. This alongside the neglect of topics supplementary to the abortion debate such as debate mechanics and philosophy makes it a smorgasbord of confusion, misunderstandings and a superiority complex. 

The standard of moderation doesn't help either.
	 comment 32: There's never been regard for rule 4. All they'll do is say you're too fixated on imaginary internet points and that you can only lose a maximum of 100 karma on this subreddit. As for downvoting, you have basically two camps. The first is incapable of appreciating a well-written PL comment because they think that all PL arguments are bad or because they deny that any example of a well-written PL comment is actually well-written. They'll try to nitpick anything you show to fervently defend why the comment is actually bad, but innocent PL comments or questions are downvoted and innocent PC comments or questions are upvoted. Many low-effort PC responses get upvoted just because they're PC friendly or made by a PCer. The second camp claim that they only downvote in rare circumstances and shift blame to the lurkers. It could be that users in the second camp rarely downvote, but my experience is that a lot of active debaters, not just spooky lurkers, downvote PL comments very often. It's obvious because you'll get a downvote almost immediately after posting your reply or right before you get a notification for their reply.

I'm all for a UBI for children so that child support is largely unnecessary.  Too often, those who are supposed to pay child support just don't pay at all, and those who do pay often don't pay the full amount, and the person this hurts the most is the child.

	 comment 44: I’m a minority that supports this. But there would have to be an ideal world where a single parent could survive on their own with the baby without going bankrupt or becoming homeless/starving. We know abortion affects people in poverty the most, so this would have to be addressed *before* allowing paper abortions.

I became increasingly sympathetic to PC arguments following a series of recent conversations with sophisticated PC. PL often highlight the salience of “responsibility” and “duty”. To this PC say that no legal duties should be foisted onto women for engaging in consensual sex [consensual sex isn’t a crime!] Just as I felicitate women for **choosing** what’s best for them, so too I felicitate men for **choosing** what’s best for them [even if the former involves abortion and the latter involves severing ties with your offspring.] In my view, neither women nor men should be stopped from having a choice; both should make what they feel is the best decision.

Imagining that I am a woman who has just become pregnant, what reason (besides brute force of law) would I have to submit to PLers' demands and gestate the pregnancy against my will?
	 comment 3: I don’t think you would have a reason other than the law, at least not a personally beneficial one. Hence we have the law. 

Similar question - what reason, besides brute force of law, would I have to submit to societal demands of not killing, stealing, not parking in a handicapped spot, paying taxes, wearing clothes in public, etc.? What’s in it for me?
	 comment 4: For me I would say performing a non-consensual sacrifice to achieve a goal, regardless of how noble, is generally wrong. We would probably agree on this point in many other scenarios, but the fundamental difference is in relation to pregnancy.

That said, let’s do everything possible to mitigate the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy. Better access to contraception, improved funding, education, maternity rights and so on. We should leave no stone unturned, but what we shouldn’t do is end the life of another person to achieve it. I believe humanity is more creative than that.
	 comment 5: Perhaps if you understood that human life begins at conception and that a ZEF is a human being in an early stage of development the same way an infant or toddler is a human being in an early stage of development, and you also believed that all human beings have equal value and deserve the right to life, then maybe you would agree that not wanting to be pregnant anymore or give birth doesn’t justify the death of your own child.

False. You've already proven that your views are completely subjective because the only "evidence" you are able to provide to support these so-called "facts" are dictionary definitions.

	comment 7: A little scenario for the PLs here about bodily autonomy.

Should sound familiar, but it's turned around this time, to try and see if you can even fundamentally understand what bodily autonomy is about and why it's important:

Let's say *I* have a moral cause I'm fighting for. Doesn't really matter what it is. The point is that *I* think that it's totally just, and right, and moral, and I think it's *the* most important thing ever. Now, the catch is that my cause requires *your* body and you oh-so-sadly will need to be harmed in the process, and you could even die. Nonetheless, *I* think that my cause is totally worth it, whatever it takes.

Now, in this scenario, this cause is not some fringe position of mine, that nobody else would agree with. Oh, no. In fact, I have a whole movement of moral and upstanding and righteous people to stand by my side, who support my cause and also think it's the most important thing ever, and they would *all* gladly give their own body and endure any harm and risk everything for the cause (even those who fundamentally can't, but just trust me on this, they *totally* would!), because it's *obviously* the only moral and right thing to do, so why wouldn't *you,* too? And we need you to do it!

But the thing is: *You* just don't agree with our cause. Or maybe you even would agree with it, in principle, and think it's a wonderful thing to do, if someone so chooses, but *you* still don't want to sacrifice yourself on behalf of it. It scares you and you don't want to be hurt! But, again, it doesn't really matter what your reasons are, the point is that *you* just want *nothing* to do with it, no matter what, and that's *final,* and you tell us to go kick rocks, because it's *your* body and your life, so we cannot just force you and use you as a means to an end!

But I and my people won't be satisfied with this! We just cannot grasp for the lifes of us why anyone would ever disagree and choose not to contribute to our cause, and we think it's a grievous moral wrong, a crime even, to selfishly withhold your body like this, so we'll *not* accept your refusal, and we'll *make* you do it, no matter what it takes, no matter how long, even if you're kicking and screaming bloody murder, your body *will* be put to use for the greater good! And if you still don't accept it, we'll throw you in jail and threaten anyone who may help you escape our grasp, as well!

Now, how does that sound for you? I and my people, we're obviously the good guys in this scenario, right?

The *only* time I see pro choice people bring this up is in response to the pro life mantra of "women are responsible for pregnancy, therefore she must gestate against her will" argument.


Really it doesn't matter who caused a pregnancy or who's supposedly "responsible" for the pregnancy coming to be. If a woman *is* currently pregnant and doesn't want to be, she can make the choice to carry the pregnancy or not.


However when pro life people jump to "She caused the pregnancy! It's *her* fault for becoming pregnant!!" it makes sense to point out that women *do not* control their eggs or implantation. Women do not have control over making a zef implant into their uteruses. If they did, infertility and unwanted pregnancy wouldn't be an issue.


Men however, *do* have control over where they shoot their sperm.


I hope this clears up your misunderstanding.

	comment 2: PC operate within the parameters of reality. Women don’t get abortions at 41 weeks for shits and giggles but PL obfuscate and distract by creating silly hypotheticals to flex their intellectual muscles as the effects of abortion bans rear their ugly head. There’s something unthinkably disturbing about using this as a playground to play with farcical abstractions at the cost of oppression.
	comment 3: It depends on the context. If you’re having like a political debate on TV, then yeah, bringing up the most extreme case you possibly imagine to try to make your opponent look bad is unfair. It’s also unfair when pro-choicers do it.

But in general, there’s nothing wrong with exploring the far edges of someone’s position. Watermelon made a post a while ago asking if pro-lifers would still want abortion banned even if it resulted in a net loss of life, and some pro-lifers actually said yes! That’s helpful, because it reveals something about the ethical principles that underlie the pro-life position. Likewise for questions about extremely late abortions.
	 comment 4: >most extreme case you possibly imagine to try to make your opponent look bad is unfair. It’s also unfair when pro-choicers do it.

How so?  What extreme case are pro-choicers nailing that shouldn't be brought up?

	 comment 6: The difference I would see between what PC advocates bring up and what PL advocates bring up is reality.  PC advocates bring up real cases of people hurt by abortion bans, like that of the 10 year old rape victim.  The ‘abortion moments before birth’ is a PL snuff fantasy that is physically impossible.  The PC advocates are talking practical reality and PL advocates are talking about pure hypotheticals.  

I don’t see why it would be important for me to know how a politician would handle immigration and border security if humans teleported, and this ‘abortion moments before birth’ is similarly far fetched.
	comment 7: >To me, the constant accusations of PC desiring to abort babies in the final weeks of pregnancy is about as silly as when PC claim that a fetus is not human or that it’s not alive.

It's probably brought up because it's a logical entailment of their position (especially bodily autonomy absolutists), whereas the other 2 are essentially false claims. Someone making a hypothetical with extemely late abortions doesn't commit them to any stance on how often they occur or whether they occur at all.

>Meaning that they also know why bringing up UUTMOB is so irrational

What do you mean by irrational?

>So what’s the deal? Why continue using the argument or continue tolerating its use?

It's brought up because it is an entailment of many PC positions. It's meant to show a distasteful conclusion of the views held. Feeling uncomfortable about late term abortions is a chink in the armour of a PC-er, especially if they are heavy proponents of absolute bodily autonomy - and PL-ers know this.
	 comment 8: Don’t you think it’s irresponsible to use a hypothetical (which happens so infrequently that the numbers are approaching zero) as a primary support for laws which irrevocably and massively impact real people? Personally, I find myself aggravated when I hear PC arguments that I find to be weak, as I think it weakens the movement as a whole. It surprises me that PL don’t seem to have the same reaction to weak arguments such as this one.

By irrational I mean that it’s a stupid argument about something that doesn’t happen. And if one were so steadfast in their anti-abortion beliefs, it wouldn’t occur to me that they’d bother making arguments that don’t make sense.

 I fail to see what is so distasteful about recognizing that term limits on abortions only punish women with complications in their wanted pregnancies. Sure, there are plenty of PC who are bodily autonomy absolutists, but that doesn’t represent the motivation of the majority of PC in keeping abortion legal at all stages. At least not as far as I can tell.

I find it regrettable and shameful that PL are willing to sacrifice women (who were doing what they’re “supposed” to do, might I add) on the altar of some opportunistic “chink in the armor” of a good-faith position held by PC.
	 comment 9: > Feeling uncomfortable

So it’s an appeal to emotion fallacy?
	 comment 10: The only way to abort a pregnancy after about 30 weeks is via c-section or induced labor. That's pretty much the only safe for the mother way to get a fetus that big out of her body. At which point, it's pretty much just early delivery.

So in order for it to turn into an abortion, they would have to inject the fetus or amniotic fluid with something.

But that has absolutely nothing to do with bodily autonomy. It also wouldn't end gestation.
	 comment 11: >  It's meant to show a distasteful conclusion of the views held

A so-called "conclusion" that has no bearing on reality has no bearing on the PC position.

> Feeling uncomfortable

Any "discomfort" you think you are sensing is probably coming from the second-hand embarrassment people get from seeing how desperate PLers are to spin this into a valid argument. 

> and PL-ers know this

PLers may delude themselves into believing they have great argument here, but it's really just a big'ol nothing-burger.

 But extremely late abortions do occur. They're to save the pregnant woman's life. 

If something goes wrong in late pregnancy and the woman's going to die if she doiesn't have an abortion, you think the woman should just die?
	comment 13: Its an easy win for PL and the logical conclusion for many PC position. If there is not a right to life and the woman has the bodily autonomy to get an abortion, why should it matter if it’s at 3 weeks, 3 months, or 9 months? 

You see it on the other side too where PC always bring up cases of rape, despite the vast majority of abortions being done on healthy pregnancies. Both sides lead with their best foot forward and it’s difficult to argue in favor of abortion up until birth or that a rape survivor should now be forced to be pregnant and give birth against their will.
	 comment 14: > If there is not a right to life and the woman has the bodily autonomy to get an abortion, why should it matter if it’s at 3 weeks, 3 months, or 9 months? 

Well, it does matter. Capricious last-second abortions are not a real thing, but medically necessary abortions do happen in the third trimester, and restriction on abortions later in pregnancy only put women's lives in unnecessary danger. I think you would be very hard pressed to find single PCer who would say that these women's lives don't matter.

>  it’s difficult to argue in favor of abortion up until birth

No it's not. I just did it. It wasn't hard at all.
	 comment 15: I'm PC and supportive of abortions at any time period, and yet I am fully capable of understanding that doesn't actually result in abortions occuring up until the moment of birth.

The issue is that PLers do not, or cannot, understand medical ethics. They actually demonstrate this on the sub quite regularly.

> You see it on the other side too where PC always bring up cases of rape

Not really comparable, since rape actually happens and abortions as a result of rape are far more likely to occur than a person carrying a pregnancy for 9 months up and "changes their mind". It's also in line with reality and doesn't contradict medical ethics, so it's REALLY not comparable to this common PL nonsense talking point.

> Both sides lead with their best foot forward

BA for PCers and a huge "OOF" for PLers 😂

> it’s difficult to argue in favor of abortion up until birth

No, it's not...?
	 comment 16: >Its an easy win for PL and the logical conclusion for many PC position.

What exactly do you mean by "easy win"? Is it like that pigeon winning a chess game by knocking down the pieces, crapping on the board and flying off? Because I don't really see how one can win anything without presenting an argument.

The article says that she then “went about her day.” You know … she might not have been at the top of her game because she had just delivered a large fetus through her genitalia on her own after being denied healthcare and she may have been kind of traumatized! I honestly don’t know what people think women are supposed to do in horrific situations like this.
	 comment 11: i have a theory that PL’s just generally assume that anybody/everybody who claims to have had a natural miscarriage is just lying and actually chose to abort on purpose.  unless it’s themself or somebody they know personally of course. 🙄
	comment 12: So I did stumble onto a blog post on the PL’s perception of this case and apparently the main sticking point for them is that because the pregnancy was spontaneously aborted after 20 weeks, that classified as a “stillbirth” rather than a “miscarriage” which is, according to the argument, the point at which we should punish someone for trying to flush the remains of their fetus rather than fishing them out. They are trying to assign personhood after 20 weeks by clinging to the term “stillbirth”, and I don’t know enough about medical terms to know why we would differentiate at that point, except to inform their medical policy going forward, but I’m pretty sure the intention wasn’t to inform potential mothers that they were legally obliged to consider their fetus as a person at this point. 

PL aren’t going to say that the stillbirth was illegal, but they are fully willing to punish a traumatized, injured victim for not sharing their *opinion* that the nonviable fetus was a fully realized human being.

	comment 2: > My view is that it doesn’t matter if abortion is killing or letting die. The killing vs letting die distinction to me seems like semantic squabbling. 

I think it is too. I have seen people who are PL but exceptions make the claim that an abortion is killing, but performing the same procedure or a similar procedure with the same outcome is letting die if it is one of their exceptions. This distinction is actually the basis for people who specifically think that salpingectomy is the only acceptable procedure for an ectopic pregnancy since it is the only one they perceive as letting die.
	 comment 3: PL, in my experience, make the distinction only with how they feel about the reason for the abortion or how they judge the morality of the person getting the abortion. It has nothing to do with anything in reality - it’s all about their perception.
	comment 4: Its irrelevant before viability.
	comment 5: The main reason I think the distinction between killing and letting die is irrelevant in this debate is that 95% of the time 'letting die' is an effective alternative to killing.

Research shows that medical abortions (letting die) are effective right up to mid way through the second trimester. Now they are usually not used much after the first tri when 'killing' is the more effective and safer option, but if alternative procedures were not available then then would still work most of the time.
	comment 6: The use of the term "killing" is a silly appeal to emotion and nothing more. Prolifers don't really believe me having an abortion at six weeks is exactly the equivalent of me killing my ten year old.

	 comment 5: Indeed. For a person living in an abortion ban state, o one consequence is they need to have to decide on abortion promptly, in order to  be able to have a self-managed telemedicine abortion (or organise travel out of state). They can't afford time for thought.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is one reason for an increased abortion rate. 

Plus, anyone living in an abortion ban state who knows they have a higher-than-average chance of something going wrong,  the sensible thing to do is to have a precautionary abortion while it can be easily managed, since otherwise they could be heading into danger with no help in sight. 

Good thing prolifers don't care about *preventing* abortions.

	comment 2: If more men were willing to step up and take care of their disabled infants, fewer women would choose abortion. Fact.
	 comment 3: That is probably true. That being said, if men would take responsibility for their own sperm there would be fewer unintended pregnancies.

But then, prolife has very little to say about controlling men.
	 comment 4: Sad fact is we can't even statistically get men to take care of an ill wife. You want him to go even a step farther and take care of a kid?
	comment 5: Mother is the female parent of a child, father is the male parent of a child. The duties and obligations of parenthood are generally unique to each couple and a lot more fluid now than they used to be. For my family personally, we have fairly traditional roles with my primary role as a provider and my wife largely the nurturer. There's obviously more to it, overlap and such, but the broad gist is that.

1. As a pro-lifer, I do believe that the woman should give birth and that there's a kid at the end of the pregnancy, yes.
2. No. I wouldn't want a child to stay with someone that doesn't want him or won't love him. I wholeheartedly endorse adoption for any unwanted children after birth.

3 & 4. That's a bit longer to explain. First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent. Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice the legal consensus is that father has no say in it. But he DOES automatically have a legal and financial obligation. If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing. 

But that alone isn't the sum of the issue. The government will frequently receive the money from child support. A mother might not ask for a dime from the father but if she uses public services, the father might still have to pay. This has been found true in cases where the father was just a donor and it had been understood he would not be involved or have any rights to the child. The government didn't care and demanded their pound of flesh regardless. And as often as the rape scenario comes up in the abortion talk, it does happen that a man can be raped against his will (often statutorily), become an unwilling parent, and have to financially compensate his rapist with child support. Further, the court can charge more money than a man actually earns in child support if they just believe that he can do better. And there's no way out of under the debt. Bankruptcy does not discharge child support. It's pauper's jail for him.

All that said though? I don't actually oppose child support. I think it's a corrupt system, fraught with things that need to be overhauled and addressed, but the basic premise I firmly agree with. The welfare of the child is paramount. The father has no less an obligation just because he didn't carry the child.
	 comment 6: okay so how do you define parent? 

>First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent.

you mean like the rights to not ejaculate inside a woman?

> If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing. 

he's the only one who controls where he ejaculates. that is not inequality

> This has been found true in cases where the father was just a donor and it had been understood he would not be involved or have any rights to the child. The government didn't care and demanded their pound of flesh regardless.

source? 
 
>it does happen that a man can be raped against his will (often statutorily), become an unwilling parent, and have to financially compensate his rapist with child support.

I believe that's happened once, total. also, a woman was forced to pay child support TO HER RAPIST after she was not allowed to abort her child. it goes both ways, it's shitty both ways. allowing abortion is one of the best solutions.

>Further, the court can charge more money than a man actually earns in child support if they just believe that he can do better. 

what's wrong with this? I fully support this. a man shouldn't be allowed to work a super low paying job just to get out of paying decent child support money 

>And there's no way out of under the debt. Bankruptcy does not discharge child support. It's pauper's jail for him.

shouldn't have ejaculated inside a woman. 

> I think it's a corrupt system

how so?
	 comment 7: > First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent. Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice the legal consensus is that father has no say in it.

There's no inequality. The man has a right to do what he wishes with his own body, and should take responsibility for that. In fully-consensual sex, it's entirely the man's responsibility where he puts his penis and where he ejaculates. If he causes an unwanted pregnancy, it's then entirely the woman's responsibility to decide what to do with her own body - whether to continue the pregnancy or terminate. Complete equality.

Obviously, if the man's decided to risk engendering an unwanted pregnancy, it's his responsibility if she needs to abort: and if she decides to have a baby,  the baby is owed child support by both parents. Generally, the man ends up paying financially and the woman ends up paying the higher cost of personal care. So it's not *quite* equality, as a child usually costs a man less to have than a woman.
	 comment 8: >As a pro-lifer, I do believe that the woman should give birth and that there's a kid at the end of the pregnancy, yes.

Correction: you want to force women to give birth. Take responsibility for your beliefs.

>No. I wouldn't want a child to stay with someone that doesn't want him or won't love him. I wholeheartedly endorse adoption for any unwanted children after birth.  
>

Men have complete and total control over their own reproductive role. You don't get a "say" in what a woman does with her body, just like she doesn't get a "say" in what you do with yours. 

>But he DOES automatically have a legal and financial obligation. If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing.

What "needs addressing"? You have no say in what someone else does with your body. A woman getting or not getting an abortion isn't a violation of your rights, since you have no right to her body. Very illuminating that you apparently think you do.

>But that alone isn't the sum of the issue. The government will frequently receive the money from child support.

Cutting a check every month to which their child is \*entitled\* to is not oppression. And, if the billions in unpaid child support if anything to go by, the laws themselves are not enforced appropriately. Take a look at financial situations of single mothers vs. (largely non-custodial) single fathers before you start abloo-blooing about how oppressed men are for having to the the absolute bare minimum.

I find it hilarious how the same PL men who demand women suffer immense pain, humiliation, and lifelong trauma to gestate and birth unwanted ZEFs will crumple into a sad little pile over having to potentially cut a check.
	 comment 9: >First, as it stands now, paternal rights are largely non-existent. Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice the legal consensus is that father has no say in it.

In my state, that is not true.  If a couple is married and not legally separated at the time of birth, he is listed on the birth certificate automatically, same as the mother, so he gets parental rights at the exact same moment she does.  Prior to the birth certificate, there is no legal parent here to grant parental rights to.  (If they aren't married, he needs to sign an affidavit of paternity attesting that he is the father before he can be named on the birth certificate.)

> If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing.

Since he can't take over gestation for her, I don't see the inequality there.  If she does keep it and he doesn't want any legal or physical custody of the child, he is not required to take it, so he is free to not parent this child.

>A mother might not ask for a dime from the father but if she uses public services, the father might still have to pay.

All for not insisting custodial parents get a child support agreement in place in order to receive public services.

>This has been found true in cases where the father was just a donor and it had been understood he would not be involved or have any rights to the child. 

That is not the case in my state at all.  Sperm donors are well protected from ever having to pay for child support, assuming they go through a legal process to be a sperm donor.  

>And as often as the rape scenario comes up in the abortion talk, it does happen that a man can be raped against his will (often statutorily), become an unwilling parent

In my state, there is protection against this.  He would not be listed on the birth certificate, as he would either have a pending legal separation or never be married to his rapist.  He cannot be listed on the birth certificate without an affidavit of paternity, and my state doesn't follow the relevant Illinois ruling and would not demand he sign an affidavit of paternity or pay child support.  

>Further, the court can charge more money than a man actually earns in child support if they just believe that he can do better. 

In my state, child support is capped at 25% of your adjusted gross income based on the previous year's state tax filing and can be revised at any time with a quarterly income filing.  Child support is capped at $15,000 a month, regardless of how much money one has, so you could have private army money and 10 kids by three different women, but you'd never pay more than $15,000 a month total.

>It's pauper's jail for him.

My state, like all US states, does not have a pauper's or debtors jail.
	 comment 10: >Mother is the female parent of a child, father is the male parent of a child.

Quite cishet of you. What about people who fall outside the gender binary? What about a pregnant person who doesn't want to be referred to as a "mother?" Is that something you would respect? I ask because a lot of PL, unsurprisingly, don't.

>The duties and obligations of parenthood

Where does this come from?

>I do believe that the woman should give birth and that there's a kid at the end of the pregnancy, yes.

Why do you feel entitled to demand women give birth?

>I wholeheartedly endorse adoption for any unwanted children after birth.

How come? I thought there are duties and obligations that come with parenthood. What happened to those?

>If she wants to terminate and he doesn't, too bad. If she wants to keep it and he doesn't, too bad. So there is a baseline inequality there that needs addressing.

Why should he get a say in what happens to her body? The "baseline inequality" is that, currently, only AFABs can gestate.

>The welfare of the child is paramount.

I call bullshit. If so, you wouldn't be "wholeheartedly endorsing adoption" aka legalized child trafficking. I work in the foster care system, I see this shit up close and it's mad fucked up.
	 comment 11: Excuse me what finacial obligation at all does he have before birth? And women have the exact same post birth obligation plus end up caring for the kid physically in or out of a relationship.
	 comment 12: I think that a lot of people are demanding the woman do both providing (work full time) AND childcare.  There are multiple studies showing women who work full time STILL do more chores & childcare.  That's just a recipe for caretaker burnout and resentment and dead bedrooms.  

I notice that you allow way more nuance with deadbeat dads.  

People make a stink about child support but less than half of custodial parents get the full amount.

[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-tps03.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-tps03.html)

"Approximately two-thirds (69.3 percent) of custodial parents who were due child support received some payments from noncustodial parents, while only 43.5 percent reported receiving the full amount of child support due. "

Also even if the non-custodial parent actually DID pay half of what it takes to raise the kid, the custodial parent is still fucking screwed if said non-custodial parent never does any of the labor like partial custody is granted but the non-custodial parent skips a lot of visitation.

Even going so far as to dishonestly put forward a limit that they know they will whittle down later or pushing bans on contraceptives.

I was willing to make compromises but currently the PL is trying to ban abortion completely and willing to be deceptive to do it. It doesn’t help their arguments or cause at all.
	 comment 7: Yes definitely. To be honest, I don't trust PL at all. They are the type to take a mile when you give an inch. 

Every post on here asking PL about what compromises they are willing to make, the most common one I see is "life threat." Which is so fucked up?? That is NOT a compromise, that should already be on the roster. The fact that so many PL think of a life threat as compromise just tells me that they would rather these people die but they will begrudgingly compromise because they know how fucked up it is if they don't.
	 comment 8: Good point. I was willing to have the compromise that Roe v Wade was, but now that I've seen it overturned and that PL won't take a compromise - I've realized that I can't have one either.

	comment 9: > Someone seeking an abortion who is denied an abortion (and has no other way to access it) now has to continue the pregnancy regardless of if they want to or not.

This is slavery if a pregnancy is continued against her will, and not just during pregnancy, but for the next 18 years after the birth.

While I believe that the right to one's own body should be absolute and inherent, I can respect this.
	comment 13: You're arguing from a false premise. Many rights that we all have at some points are not available to us at others. It doesn't mean we suddenly don't have rights.

A five year old doesn't have that right. Does that mean they suddenly have no rights? That they are required to be celibate their entire lives? That the government can issue weekly hymen checks to ensure that they can never possibly have sex?

No, that's ludicrous. Like arguing that because you can't abort your child other people now have carte blanche access to your body and you're a slave to their will.

Rights evolve. Many are conditional. Your right to freedom can be suspended if you commit a crime. Your right to travel does not extend to unlawful trespass. Your right to commerce doesn't allow you to purchase illegal items or services. None of these mean you're suddenly without rights at all.
	 comment 14: >You're arguing from a false premise. Many rights that we all have at some points are not available to us at others. It doesn't mean we suddenly don't have rights. 

The specific argument for prolifers is: When a woman or a child is pregnant, she ceases to have human rights. Basic human rights, inalienable, which every other human has from birth to death: for prolifers, pregnancy simply makes her less than human.

Now, you are trying to argue that other rights can't be exercised at some times, like a five year old not having the "right" to intercourse. (A very odd "right" for you to pick on, since most people don't think of sexual intercourse with a consenting partner as a "right" but as a joy and pleasure.) 

But the human rights which are necessarily violated by prolifers in imposing abortion bans aren't "this is the wrong time for you to exercise this right" rights - these are rights which are upheld by free access to abortion on demand and violated by abortion denial.
	 comment 15: >Many rights that we all have at some points are not available to us at other (points). 

Congrats, you've just acknowledged why the Pro life argument is bullshit.   RTL does not and cannot obligate gestation.

Of course, but only another consenting person unlike


>A five year old doesn't have that right.

Of course a 5yr old doesn't, they don't even know consent is let alone comprehend consent or sex and what it can or does entail, because they are a child. 

>Does that mean they suddenly have no rights?

No that means they have limited abilities to consent to certain things, but they still have rights and this is where the limited rights come into play unlike adults who are able to consent and acknowledge comprehension. 

>That they are required to be celibate their entire lives?

They shouldn't be engaging in sex until they are of age to know what consent is or even sex. An adult can't have sex with the child either. 

>That the government can issue weekly hymen checks to ensure that they can never possibly have sex?

I would consider that an intrusive bodily check for absolutely no reason besides to appease PL and their beliefs. 


>No, that's ludicrous. Like arguing that because you can't abort your child other people now have carte blanche access to your body and you're a slave to their will.

How is that ludicrous, when someone wants an abortion but that access is banned?  They are essentially held a slave against their will because of PL ideology. 



>. None of these mean you're suddenly without rights at all.

Funny how you name all these limited rights but don't mention a single one of your body and what limited rights we have to do what we want with them.
	 comment 18: >Many rights that we all have at some points are not available to us at others.

Yes. But the right of what happens to YOUR OWN BODY should *always* be available. 

>A five year old doesn't have that right.

Yes because they are *minors*. 

Don't come in here using children as pawns when you know damn well they would be forced to give birth under PL law. We've already seen it. 

>you're a slave to their will.

Yes. Pregnant people are slaves to the wills of pro life. 

>Your right to freedom can be suspended if you commit a crime.

What crime did someone who had sex or get raped commit? 

>Your right to travel does not extend to unlawful trespass.

Who is trespassing when trying to access abortion?

> Many are conditional. 

Yes, obviously. The examples you gave are due to illegal actions someone took. Those examples are punishments. Is this you admitting that gestation is nothing more than a way to punish people for having sex?
	 comment 19: >That the government can issue weekly hymen checks to ensure that they can never possibly have sex?


"This belief that the hymen provides physical "proof" of sexual history is the premise of virginity testing, a practise condemned by the World Health Organization in 2018 as a human rights violation. Such tests can take different forms; everything from physical examinations of measuring a hymen or vaginal laxity to wedding night rituals where a bloodied bedsheet is expected to appear, and even be shown to the bride and groom's families.

Despite this having no scientific basis – and despite virginity itself being a social construct with no biological reality – millions around the world continue to believe that a woman's sexual history is somehow writ into her anatomy, and that all cisgender women bleed the first time that they have sex. 

The hymen is a small, membranous tissue that may be found near the opening of the vagina. It is really quite incredible that a tiny piece of seemingly purposeless tissue has been ascribed so much factually inaccurate purpose. 

Many people erroneously believe that the hymen seals over the vagina, not realising that that would mean a woman wouldn't be able to menstruate (a minority of people do have this condition, and can get a hymenectomy to help open the channel). Instead, most hymens have an annular or crescent-moon shape, and may take many forms of varying thinness and thickness. Few of us would have been told that it can change with age, that some of us aren't born with one, or that it might totally disappear by the time we enter sexual maturity anyway. Or that a wide variety of activity can stretch or tear it, from exercise to masturbation to, yes, penetrative sex.


But this doesn't mean there's any validity to the idea that you can ascertain sexual activity with a hymen examination. One small study of 36 pregnant teenagers published in 2004, for example, found that medical staff were only able to make "definitive findings of penetration" in two cases. Another 2004 study found that 52% of sexually active adolescent girls interviewed had "no identifiable changes to the hymenal tissue". A binary idea that either we are sexually active and have no visible hymen, or that we aren't sexually active and do have one, is simply not accurate. 

Blood on the bedsheet, a type of virginity test used around the world, is also based on falsehoods. Some hymens may bleed when first stretched if the act is abrupt or if you aren't relaxed, but any blood is actually far more likely to come from lacerations to the vaginal wall due to forceful sex or a lack of lubrication. Bleeding from first-time sex may or may not happen, just like bleeding from anytime sex may or may not happen. Reasons for bleeding during sex include feeling anxious, not being fully aroused or experiencing some aggravation from things like infections. When one obstetrician surveyed 41 of her colleagues, asking them if they bled the first time they had sex or not, 63% of them said that they had not."

Lol how you whine about nuance and say this in the same breath?

Everything I said stands:

\-their body isn't theirs to decide what to do with --> pregnant people cannot decide what to do with their body.

\--saying no or what you want doesn't matter --> pregnant people cannot say no to continue a pregnancy. someone who wants an abortion will be denied one because them wanting one does not matter.

\--other people have the right to demand by who, when, why, and how long your body is used --> PL demand pregnant people allow the ZEF to use their body until the gestation is complete.

Which of this is incorrect? Which of this is not "specific enough?" I didn't think I had to give examples for each, but clearly I was wrong.

However you said "kill humans if you feel like it" is just downright incorrect. When you have to downplay abortion and gestation to *this*, I call bullshit.

ETA:

>telling kids that’s it’s acceptable to kill human beings if you feel like it.

1. There's a difference between letting die and killing, but I'm okay with conceding here.
2. I have *zero* qualms about telling kids that it's acceptable to use any amount of force necessary to remove and/or stop someone from being inside, harming, and using their body against their will. So actually, you're fucking wrong because I am VERY comfortable telling kids that.
	 comment 26: >kill human beings

	 comment 27: its not acceptable to kill a human being just “because you feel like it”. but it is acceptable to kill an individual who is inside your body against your will when it is the minimum force necessary to remove said individual from inside your body. it’s called self defense. not murder. this concept applies to both unwanted unborn zefs AND born rapists.

No, it's misleading because it's **not true.** It's not our position. It's PL's position; it's their straw man.

Your 'explanation' for why it's a misleading statement is also misleading, unsurprisingly, and again, not because it's non-specific but because it's simply not true. But 'non-specific', lol - how else would one 'explain' chronic untruthfulness one cannot defend and lacks the moral resolve to correct, ever?

Truth matters in public schools. Truth matters to the general public at large. Or should I be telling you this? Maybe I'd best let your own BS detector bring it to your attention.

Which, of course, is women who get stuck with unwanted pregnancies for whatever reason(s) and decide that they don't want to **stay** pregnant and want an abortion instead.

This is disingenuous. PC have never once claimed that PL are forcing people to have sex, and framing your side as "we simply want to protect life" completely ignores the actual issue. 

You're trying to force people to have their bodies used non-consensually so your feelings aren't hurt about the death of another person. That's controlling what another person does with their body. 

To put this another way, it would be like preventing someone from backing out of sexual intercourse when they have made it clear they do not wish to continue. That's controlling someone's body.

	 comment 44: >Well its that they learn they don’t have the right to murder the child in the womb because they desire it, 

An abortion isn’t a ‘desire’ it’s a necessity for a start for some girls and women. 

>its saying that Morality is defined by an objective, a Creator who is above us its using logic with morals and not dictating it by subjective garbage, 

You can keep your religion to yourself, it doesn’t apply to anyone who doesn’t believe in it. I don’t believe any god (including yours) created me and I don’t follow your religion so do not have to abide by the laws of your religion. 

>if you define morality by opinion you cant be right ever, every opinion differs so everything is good and bad evil and righteous it’s incompatible. 

Okay, then you have no right to determine is abortion is moral based on your opinion that women are doing it because they ‘desire’ killing the ZEF. You don’t have any right to determine that sex before marriage is immoral or contraception use is immoral because it is based on your *opinion* that comes from your religion. Unless of course you can objectively prove that sex before marriage or contraception use is immoral *without* appealing to your god or religious book. 

>Its teaching that the consent of this begins at sex, 

Consent to one thing is not consent to another and consent cannot be transferred. Consent is given to sex (at which point the ZEF doesn’t even exist), not to the continued gestation of a ZEF that may or may not come in to existence. 

>its teaching that violations of human rights via slaughter of the fetus is not okay even if the father is a garbage human being a rapist a whatever. 

For a start, abortion access is deemed a human right and no foetus is ‘slaughtered’ especially considering most abortions are done by pill and all that does is stop the woman’s body producing a hormone which stops the pregnancy continuing. Oh and forcing a girl or woman to give birth to a baby conceived in rape is utterly disgusting and shows how little you value women and their suffering. I believe anyone without a rape exception is just as bad as any rapist as you are forcing someone to be continuously violated for you and your beliefs; it’s never about what’s best for the victim. 

>Its teaching you don’t own and have dominion over other human beings in any stage of life. 

Dominion is a religious concept and doesn’t apply to those of us who are not religious. Also, I have control over my body including who gets to be inside of it at any given point. 

>Its teaching that trauma of birth is always so much lighter than the trauma of slaughtering your own child in your womb. 

Let me guess, you’ve never been through pregnancy and birth? I would say an abortion at 8 weeks is significantly less physically traumatising than giving birth to a full term foetus which has a 90% chance of genital tearing in first births and a 30% rate of c section which is a major abdominal surgery. By comparison, passing an 8 week embryo is a whole lot easier and less physically traumatising. We also know that a majority of women do not regret their abortions at all, even 5 years after having the abortion, showing that abortion is often not even mentally traumatising. We also know that many, many women report significant birth trauma and many will opt to not have any more children based on a previous horrific experience of birth. 

>And when you tell children about how the right thing and the Law should be is that you never you don’t ever murder your child like its your little play thing and to respect the sanctity of life which every human has will only progress society.

No one sees a ZEF as their ‘little play thing’ - that is a ridiculous claim to make. 

If every human has the sanctity of life that means you don’t believe in lethal self defence right? It means you don’t believe in any war or the death penalty or anything where another human dies, right?
	 comment 45: >Well its that they learn they don’t have the right to murder the child in the womb because they desire it, its saying that 

But "the womb" is a living independent person with reason and conscience, even if you dehumanise her to one of her internal organs. No one thinks abortion is murder. And people don't have abortions because they "desire murder": they have abortions either because some man engendered an unwanted pregnancy, or something has gone wrong with a wanted pregnancy. Prolifers may not like to understand these facts, but they're all true.  


>Its teaching that the consent of this begins at sex, its teaching that violations of human rights via slaughter of the fetus is not okay

And do you believe prolifer men  need to take responsibility for their consent in engendering an unwanted pregnancy which will then be aborted, by always using a condom every time or else not ejaculating inside a woman's  vagina and so not causing an abortion?

Violating a non breathing, non feeling human with no individual life - major issue. 

Violating a breathing, feeling woman with individual life - no problem. She’s Just an incubating object to be used, greatly harmed, even killed, as needed. She has no human rights. 

I always wonder where you people get your so-called morals from. Because pro life’s treatment of women is absolutely inhumane. 

The arguments of religious pro lifers are especially inhumane, as is proven by your statement about rape.

Why should everyone follow laws and rules that require suspension of all empathy and sympathy and reality?

Your statement about owning humans is also rather ironic, because you’re teaching that a fetus absolutely DOES own and has dominion over the woman, her body, and her life.

	 comment 52: >its saying that Morality is defined by an objective, a Creator who is above us its using logic with morals

Believing in morality by a creator at its core is morality by opinion.  

There is no appreciable difference. You still have to use your opinion to 1) decide a creator is real 2) decide which creator of the 5000+ that people have believed in is the real one(if you believe in just one) 3) decide which belief system and which sect and which dogma you to believe to be true and will follow 4) actually follow those beliefs (how many religious leaders have gone against their beliefs for example and abused others, including children).
	 comment 53: > Well its that they learn they don’t have the right to murder the child in the womb because they desire it

Yes, exactly. They learn that what you just said is fallacious PL propaganda, and that abortion has absolutely no relation to "murdering children." And from there, it is easy to understand that they *do* have the right to terminate a pregnancy because they desire it.

> Its teaching that the consent of this begins at sex

Yes, consent for sex begins and ends with sex. Consent to pregnancy is wholly separate, and the use of one's own body by another human can be always be denied.

> Its teaching that trauma of birth is always so much lighter than the trauma of slaughtering your own child in your womb

Right. And since there is no child being slaughtered, the trauma of abortion is non-existent.

When that "other human being" is inside their body, yes, they do. One has the right to self-defense, and does not need to be literally on the verge of death to enact this right. The ZEF's unwanted presence in her body alone constitutes sufficient grounds for removal.

>Yes, that is because unless another human being is actively killing you then NO one has the right to kill another.

Ahh so according to your logic, I can't remove my rapist off me or make choices regarding their body unless I'm actively being killed by them. And considering that the majority of rapes are non fatal, by your logic, rape victims just have to let themselves get raped, right?

But also. How fucking pathetic that the bar is so low that it's *death*? Just say you don't respect AFABs, that's less insulting that this shit.

	 comment 4: Since i've gotten the shots, aside from several other things that happened to me as a ditect cause of it, my periods have been more painful, heavier, and they've added a whole new "i'll spot for 3-5 days before I start just to let you know i'm there OH PSYCHE, NOPE. Oh, maybe...ye- FAKEOUT."
	 comment 5: I got my moderna booster in November and had a super short cycle in Dec and it's looking like it could be the same for Jan.

I won't say for sure it's the booster though. I am at a common age for changes in cycle and stress can do a number on me
	 comment 6: Yes! this. And I get anxious cause the conspiracy subreddits talking about how it makes women infertile 😭🤚🏽
	 comment 7: Yep, it made my cycle 22-25 days instead of the usual 27/28.
	 comment 8: Idk if it was the booster or because I had Covid before the booster but I didn’t have a period for 4 months, then had light bleeding, and then I had like a weird period last week.
	comment 9: I'm I the only one experiencing some weird stuff since I took the 2nd shot of Pfizer? Immediately after taking the shot my circle was 48 days. Then I had one that lasted 30 days. Now I'm in my 38st day and no period. I have some symptoms but no period at all. Anyone going through the same? Is this normal? Help a girl out
	 comment 10: Exact same boat as you. I’m terrified tbh
	 comment 11: [deleted]
	 comment 12: Really weird for me too. I'm on day 65 now, usually my cycles are around 30 days 😬😬
	 comment 13: My hormones were completely ruined after the 2nd Pfizer. I still get my period, but the week leading up and and the week during, i am in absolute hell. Panic attacks, shaking, lightheaded, dizzy, extremely depressed and anxious. Some days i cant get out of bed. I got it in November and it’s been messed up ever since. You’re not alone!
	comment 14: Hi all, posting this hoping to see if anyone else is experiencing a similar thing.

After my 2nd vaccine, I had one small lump and had it checked out with an ultrasound. I was cleared and doctors told me it was a swollen node from the vaccine, no signs of cancer.

I got the booster 11/21, and it’s a cluster of lumps, same breast. My gyno was concerned this time, and we did an ultrasound again. No signs of cancer, but I had this new patch of dense breast tissue. It’s end of Feb, there are a couple lingering lumps and my breast doesn’t feel the same. My doctor did Not think it was connected to the vaccine, but there’s no way this happened exactly the same time as getting my shot(s). I’m 29, I had my checkup before the 1st vaxx, and I check myself too.

I’m pro vaxx, but I’m hearing more side affects with women and their breasts and menstrual cycles… but it’s like no one is hearing me. Now I have to keep an eye on these lumps, probably do more testing with no real peace of mind.
	 comment 15: > but there’s no way this happened exactly the same time as getting my shot(s)

I guess my question is… why do you think that? Young women your age develop dense patches of breast tissue all the time. The lymph node swelling is likely the temporary side effect from the vaccine, but dense fibrocystic breast changes are extremely common in young women.
	comment 16: I’m late to this but I had period changes from my first shot. I was averaging a 33 day cycle with 6-7 days bleeding and since then it has been extremely heavy and on a cycle of 8-9 days bleeding, 10-12 days off. On the days I’m bleeding I’m filling my diva cup up 2-3x a few of those days. Towards the end maybe just once. I got the J&J July 7th and just got the Moderna as my booster on the 27th. Full on laid up in bed within 14ish hours and in constant pain, chill, fever staying around 101, nausea, cold sweats, uncontrollable shaking, leg and arm and back cramps all the way up until this morning when it just tapered off like it never even happened. The fatigue is still there. I figure I’ll post an update in a few months from here.
	 comment 17: Any updates?
	comment 18: I (31, F) had my second dose of mRNA vaccine on July 2 and since then I’ve only had my period three times…I’m very concerned about this, have had blood work done to check hormones and thyroid and everything is fine. I am not anti-vax, but really not sure if I want to go through with the booster I’m scheduled to get on Jan 16.. for reference, my cycles were typically 29 days long before this. Anyone else experiencing extremely long cycles/missing periods?
	 comment 19: F30, Took my second dose of mRNA in early September and haven't had a period since. Not anti-vax but I dont feel it is coincidence. Used to have 28 day cycle.
	 comment 20: Me. I can’t even get an appointment with a gynaecologist to discuss
	comment 21: I got my booster 4 months ago. Every week leading up to my period now there is one night, I get horrible chills and a high fever, pure exhaustion. I wake up next day and I am completely fine. It's happened now every month since my booster shot. Exactly a week before my period. Anyone else experiencing something similar or is this something more that needs a doc trip?
	 comment 22: That’s a new one to me - but if you see a doc, we’d love an update.
	comment 23: Did anyone schedule to get their vaccine around their menstrual cycle? I’ve read it’s best not to get the vaccine when you have your period. I was planning to get the J&J vaccine a week after my period. What are your thoughts?
	 comment 24: > I’ve read it’s best not to get the vaccine when you have your period.

Where’d you hear that? 

Got my first vaccine mid-cycle and got an early, angry period. Got my booster during my period, absolutely no problems.
	 comment 25: I've read this in relation to yearly flu vaccines first, and then checked my vaccination schedule and period trackers to compare it with my own experience: if you get any vaccine (or illness) on a high-estrogen day you should get a relatively better protection, BUT also more period changes. Not on a high-estrogen day? Less period changes but also somewhat less effect of the vaccine as a result. So to each their own I guess. (I personally prefer higher protection, but also I'm lazy synch my vaccination schedule to high estrogen days.)

From the mRNA vaccines specifically (I got 2 doses of Pfizer so far) I didn't see a lot of period changes, maybe 2 days late or so, but like I didn't get them on a high estrogen day anyway.

Now.... A few years ago I got chickenpox vaccines on high estrogen days, those threw me off for months. Eg I immediately went to have a 48-day period, and then it took a few months for it to go back to normal. (I'm normally very regular, also haven't been on hormonal birth control for well over a decade, etc, nothing to mess with my periods.)

I do read a lot of anecdotes these days on especially women with IUDs suffering from period changes post vaccine, luckily I didn't have an IUD in while getting vaccinated. But that could be a massive variable, too.

If you google immunology and estrogen, there are better sources on this than my comment.
	 comment 26: This is a myth. You can get it any time
	 comment 27: I've only had my first Pfizer shot, in September.  My period is totally off bit it wasn't regular to begin with.
	 comment 28: Yes I had it on Friday the first day of my period and wow I’ve never been in so much pain! My period cramps are crippling. My back is even in pain now.
	comment 29: I experienced the heaviest and most painful period in my entire existence after my first shot of Moderna.  I am peri-menopausal at 52 yo and and my cycle is not regular...sometimes 2 weeks apart, sometimes 3 months between cycles. But my cycle after my 1st shot of Moderna was was actually frightening. It has been "normal" since but I just got my booster after Christmas. A few days ago, I started another super heavy and painful cycle but nothing compared to the pain and volume after my 1st shot. Was speaking to my neighbor who is around the same age, and she said the same thing happen to her but she had Pfizer.
	comment 30: I got my booster (Moderna) while I was on my period Sunday. I finished my period Monday (after 4 days total) and now I have this INSANE spasming and pain in my left ovary (the side I got my vax on) 
Anyone else get this?? I've heard of periods being affected but nothing about just pain in the ovary.  It's driving me insane 😩 

My first 2 vax were Pfizer. Also I am on BC
	 comment 31: Omg I just had this too! Exactly this. I’m in so much pain I thought I was pregnant
	comment 32: Just wondering if anyone has had their periods delayed by a really long time, and how long it took to get back to normal?

I had my 1st vaccine on November 15th, about a week after ovulating that month. My period that month came 2 days early but I didn't think anything of it.

I got my 2nd vaccine on January 5th, 3 days before I was meant to ovulate. I didn't ovulate that month, and haven't had a period since then.

I'm now on day 65 of my cycle and still no sign of ovulation or period. Also have tested many times and I'm definitely not pregnant. Has anyone had something similar, and how long did it take your period to return?? 

I'm quite worried about it, my husband and I have recently started trying for a baby and just really worried that I'm never going to get it back 😬
	 comment 33: I got Covid last May and by June my cycle was very delayed. I was having like 43-45 day cycles. I think it’s not just the vaccine. I was vaccinated with Moderna later that August (I did both shots) 

My period is finally normal again as of my last two cycles. Back down to 31 day cycles. It’s time for me to get my booster and I’m scared.
	 comment 34: My period was five days late after the second shot and when I got covid, my cycle was 50 days long. This seems to be pretty common
	 comment 35: There is an average of two weeks of variation after the shot.
	comment 36: Besides irregular periods, has the booster made anyone else feel like their hormones are raging? (28 F)

I had my IUD taken out on Dec of 2020, I luckily, didn’t really feel like I had a mirena crash. My acne alleviated for most weeks, my periods were better than they were before the IUD, and my yeast infections became less frequent.

I got my third Covid shot in Dec 2021. My period in January didn’t come until day 40 (usually 35), but beyond that I feel.. so aware of my hormones. I am super aware of when I’m ovulating and I start breaking out terribly, sex drive changes drastically (that part is not bad, just different!). My breasts also get huge once I hit ovulation and stay that way until my period and they hurt :( I’ve also been getting cystic acne around this time that starts getting better before my period and then I start breaking out badly again during my period. 

I went from having nearly perfect skin a year post-IUD removal and now my acne is almost bad as bad as when I had it in:( anyone else have this experience post booster? Just wondering if I can count on evening out or if this is just an age thing.
	comment 37: So I got my booster in the evening and the next morning I got my period. That was December. I experienced all the usual stuff two weeks before my period. My period started 6 days early!
	 comment 38: I had that happen with my first vaccine shot, but no changes with the booster.
	comment 39: I've had both shots and the Booster in October. I personally didn't experience any changes in my period that were out of the ordinary.
	comment 40: I've (29F) had my liletta IUD for several years and it "expires" April 2022.  Hindsight, after reading forums and such, I'm pretty sure my symptoms  (hair loss, fatigue, migraines, depression, anxiety and others) came from the IUD.  They have progressively gotten worse of the years to the point where I was seeing specialists for brain tumors, infectious disease, and hypothyroid (2018 - beginning 2020).  In Oct 2021 I got Covid vaccinated  and my mood has been way out of whack.  My periods have been the same, and regular but I get like 2 weeks of severe depression, anxiety, constant crying for no reason on top of the migraines I had previously. I think the vaccine is interrupting the effectiveness/hormones of the IUD and planned on getting it removed to see if it will help regulate my system.  After reading about what to expect with removal of a hormonal IUD, I'm now concerned about a hormone crash and if maybe my iud migrated which is causing these issues; maybe it just happened to be around vaccination time.  I know vaccines alter the flow (because of stressing about  covid BS) but has the vaccination weirdly affected just the mood?  Have you had IUD migration without obvious pain of perforation?  I did have a gyno appointment for removal but it was canceled twice from docs being sick. 

Honestly I could care less about Covid and besides IUD symptoms I have actually had the best 2 years of my life. So it's not like I'm scared/stressed which is causing these issues.
	 comment 41: No, the vaccine could not interrupt the IUD hormones
	 comment 42: I have had this as well but with my pills. I take continuous birth control pills and I have never had any issues. After my booster, I get insane cramping when I am supposed to be on my period (but it is suppressed) and I get what feels like ovulation pain... Which was the whole reason I was put on the pills. I then started to get insanely moody and it just seems like my hormones are all out of whack.... I've had other things happen too including low body temperature that my doc was sure was hypothyroidism but all tests say I am healthy af. 
Now I am trying to find a way to fix everything that was totally fine before the booster....
	comment 43: hi everyone! i had mt pfizer booster shot 2 weeks ago and had my period*/bleeding* just now. is this normal?? does everyone else experienced this??
	 comment 44: It’s not clear when you were expecting your period, but a fair number of women have had a couple wonky cycles around vaccinations. Not everyone, though.
	comment 45: I had my booster (Pfizer) right before Christmas. I ended up having an allergic reaction/ arm
Rash/ pain but then the next month while on birth control I got my period during the 3rd week of active pills. I went to the gynecologist and switched pills. I just started week 3 today and bleeding again.
	comment 46: I got my Pfizer a few months ago and it didn't change my period itself, but now I get extremely heavy PMS. prior to me getting it, my gf and I never argued. now I have massive emotional breakdowns for 2-3 days before every period. It still hasn't gone away and it's been maybe 5 months
	comment 47: I was on my period when I got my booster jab. Since that day which was 3 days ago my stomach has been so swollen and I’ve had the worst stabbing pains. So bad it’s crumpling my whole body and my back is in so much pain! Has anyone else had this?
	comment 48: has anyone experienced any neuropathic issues? muscle twitching, burning pain, cramping?
	comment 49: Has anyone’s period NOT returned to normal after several months after taking the vaccine? I had my last covid shot in June and it hasn’t been the same since. Some months are normal but other months my period comes late still. Before the vaccine it was very consistent. Talked to my doctor about getting birth control to regulate my period as I haven’t used birth control in years and I cannot get a prescription with estrogen. Only progestin which she says can make your period irregular or non-existent.
	comment 50: Has anyone got any recommendations on how to ease the bloat of my stomach since the vaccine?
	comment 51: Pfizer pregnancy trial - I got the Pfizer vaccine and I am now part of the Pfizer trial in pregnant women, I got a booster when I was 7 weeks pregnant and glad I did, because I got COVID in February and my symptoms were very mild, I am now 27 weeks pregnant and everything going very well with my baby boy. Ask away if you have any questions around COVID vaccines and fertility or pregnancy including side effects!
	comment 52: Here’s a fresh study on vaccines and menstruation from the US that used data from a period tracker: https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/9900/Association_Between_Menstrual_Cycle_Length_and.357.aspx

>Overall, COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a less than 1-day change in cycle length for both vaccine-dose cycles compared with prevaccine cycles 

The [NY Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/health/covid-vaccine-menstrual-cycles.html?campaign_id=154&emc=edit_cb_20220106&instance_id=49622&nl=coronavirus-briefing&regi_id=12770&segment_id=78893&te=1&user_id=a9a1e1148f3653d647544e3f314202de) is a lot more digestible, but paywalled.

> Some women who were vaccinated had cycles that were eight days longer than usual, which is considered clinically significant, Dr. Edelman said.

>“Though the cycle length was less than one day different at the population level, for an individual, depending on their perspective and what they’re relying on menses for, that could be a big deal,” she said. “You might be expecting a pregnancy, you might be worrying about a pregnancy, you might be wearing white pants.”

	comment 57: I had my Pfizer booster just before Christmas. My period was 46 days late and is very heavy and painful. I'm on day five and it's not letting up. This is very unusual as I only ever get light periods that last 3 days. Absolute nightmare.
	comment 58: I got my booster at the beginning of November and haven’t had my cycle since. At first I didn’t think anything of it, because I did have a two month delay when I got my first two doses but eventually my cycle resumed. 

During December and January I was also under a lot of stress so I figured that could have contributed to the delay, but since then my stress levels have gone down and I’m 4 days into my off week on my birth control and It still hasn’t showed up yet. 

At this point, I’m starting to wonder if I should call my doctor or if I shouldn’t resume my birth control again next week to try and give it some extra time to try and come back? Any thoughts on what would be best here?
	 comment 59: Talk to your doctor, but this is more likely from your birth control. You don’t really have a menstrual cycle/period if you are on the pill. The monthly bleeding is meant to mimic a period, but is called a withdrawal bleed because the pill basically overrides your normal cycle to prevent you from ovulating and getting pregnant. 

It’s pretty common for your withdrawal bleeds to be lighter (or even nonexistent) on the pill compared to your natural cycle.

Edit: my first and second doses were AstraZeneca, thus my booster will be about Pfizer or Moderna, depends on the availability of my provider.

I plan on talking to my doctor soon, but i wanted to know if anyone else had or has this issue!!?
	 comment 63: Are you sure it’s related to the vaccine and not your birth control? Because that can be a pretty common side effect of most birth control.
	comment 64: This is a subject that has been worrying me a lot, not only me but my friends and I would like to know if the women here have gone through the same... Ever since I took the third dose of Pfizer I've noticed that my period is increasingly scarce (it was decreasing with the doses) of large amounts passed to a few drops and less days. Friends of mine who also took the vaccine, the same thing is happening to them!! I'm not even 30 years old and my friends have it so it's not menopause. What vaccine did they give us to make this happen? Are the girls here also happening to them?
	 comment 65: i’ve had the opposite! since I got my pfizer booster my period came sooner and it lasts for a very long time! i’ve also had body aches, chest pain, and now recently developed severe cramps in my legs and pelvis. (this has been going on five months now)
	comment 66: Has anyone actually found a way to fix all the period craziness after the covid jabs? I'm averaging out at a period once every 2 weeks now, have been since I had the 2nd pfizer jab last september. Had an appointment about it with a nurse in december and she said I'm too young to have a smear test on the NHS and since I won't go on birth control there's nothing she can do.

It's driving me crazy, I'm exhausted all the time and getting through so many pads it's ridiculous. And now the government is starting to roll out the second lot of booster jabs (so the 4th covid jab in total) and I just...can't. I'm so scared it's going to make it even worse. Has anyone found any method at all that helped get their periods back to normal (that doesn't include birth control)?
	 comment 67: Try posting this over at r/askdocs, but that doesn’t sound like vaccine side effects.

	comment 1: It’s not a bad idea especially if you are concerned. I will say that it’s not uncommon to get cysts before your period starts, but I did learn that if they do not go away within 1 - 3 cycles, then you will want to get it checked out. It sounds like yours comes and goes, so maybe see if it goes away after your period starts. I got freaked out once over this and was perfectly fine. But of course monitor yourself.

It’s the frequent lying by OBGYN’s that really bothers me. “It won’t hurt”. “The pain is only for a few seconds”. I had a concussion that did something to my body where I had spotting for 6 months afterwards. Only time in my life.

	comment 1: Happens to me all the time! It’s generally cause my skin is far more dehydrated than I realised and the motion of getting increases the friction. I started applying a thick balm apart from just body lotion, and twice a day during the winters. 

If you don’t wanna invest just use regular body lotion/hand cream. The air around your is probably just drying you out faster cause again winters and heaters. If you are adventurous (and the itch is terrible), some organic safe coconut oil does wonders.
	 comment 2: This is really good to know, since I mostly don’t wear a bra when outside work/ hanging with family.
	comment 3: I noticed this happens when I am wearing underwire bras too much. My theory is that it cuts off the lymphatic flow.

Post 2: A key part of Obamacare is in jeopardy
	comment 1: Political mega-donors are an eccentric lot, but even among them Steven Hotze stands out. The Houston doctor got rich by hawking hormone therapies for all sorts of ills. Motivated by outlandish beliefs—birth control makes women less attractive to men and homosexual activists are “termites” who nibble away at society, to name but two—he used his money to buoy Bible-thumping politicians. When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, to expand health-insurance coverage, the hormone magnate filed lawsuits against it and released a pop-techno song, “God Fearing Texans Stop Obamacare”.

Not long ago repealing Obamacare was a rallying call of the Republican Party, which lamented that premiums had risen and forcing Americans to buy coverage or pay a penalty was unjust. Yet despite more than 2,000 court challenges the law stayed mostly intact. In the three years to 2016 the number of uninsured Americans dropped from 44m to 27m. When Donald Trump took office and Republicans controlled Congress, lawmakers failed to nix Obamacare. On November 25th Mr Trump threatened to try to scrap it in a second term. Members of his party rebuffed him: most have given up. The Republican front-runner and Mr Hotze have not.

In 2020 Mr Hotze’s company challenged part of the law that requires health insurers to pay for preventive care. The plaintiffs’ argument in Braidwood Management Inc. v Becerra is twofold. First, they say the panel of experts that chooses which services must be covered is unconstitutional because its members are not appointed by Congress. Second, they claim that forcing insurers to pay for medicines like contraceptives and pre-exposure prophylaxis, an hiv pill, violates their religious rights.

A judge in northern Texas ruled in their favour last March. The federal government appealed and the case is now pending in the Fifth Circuit, the most conservative appeals court in America. Legal experts expect it to end up in the Supreme Court.

If the preventive-care provision is struck down, as many as 152m Americans could have to pay for check-ups and medicines they now get free. Screenings for anxiety and depression, all sorts of cancers and sexually transmitted diseases would probably require copayment. So would counselling for domestic violence and alcoholism.

According to a Morning Consult poll, at least two in five Americans would forgo preventive services if they had to pay. A study from Yale University found that removing the requirement would lead to 2,000 more hiv infections each year. Democratic states are hustling to codify the requirement for insurers to cover preventive care into state law.7

Post 3: Would *short term* health insurance cover a colposcopy or LEEP procedure?
	comment 1: Likely not. Short term insurance will not cover any pre existing conditions. EDIT: which your conditions will be considered as, since you had a previous abnormal pap smear

Is there a reason why you’re not applying through the marketplace? You still have time until you are off your student plan.

Post 4: Healthcare costs vary WILDLY by hospital. I've been incredibly furstrated by the lack of price transparency when receiving care. I'm considering the idea of a tool that allows you to compare prices across hospitals. Would such a tool be beneficial? Would love to discuss
	comment 1: I thought about something like this a while ago but had no idea how to do it.

One of the main issues is going to be when you look at combined costs which are most of what people get. Not many people go to the hospita for just a head CT, it's usually a head CT plus Radiology fees plus doctor fees for whoever ordered it, etc.
	 comment 2: It’s a great point. Do you think that would deter people from using overall? I would think some transparency is better than none
	comment 3: You also have to consider in network vs self pay pricing. And every insurance has different contracted rates for the same service at the same hospital. And that can be considered proprietary information. 

It hasn’t been done for a reason. 

Good luck!
	 comment 4: Interestingly there was a law passed in 2021 requiring hospitals to post this data. It’s mostly done in a way that’s not consumer friendly. But I was able to get the data to make that picture
	comment 5: No commercial insurance pays sticker price, liens on WC etc. are negotiated. Government health plans pay very listless. It would be interesting if you could turn this into guidance for the consumer as to what they should offer to pay.
	comment 6: No.  All you have is the *bid*, what you need is the *strike*.  It's like walking into a car dealership, knowing nothing but the MSRP.

Now, if we really knew what contracts were *settling* for, that would be great information.

We have an approximation of that, due to Medicare price fixing.  If you know the MAC, you know the strike should be between 1x and 1.2x

eta: I meant "ask" duh.  That's a *semantic* paraphasic error, in case yall were wondering
	comment 7: This also wouldn't work because hospitals aren't restaurants with menus. If you show up to an ER demanding a head CT, that's not your right. The doctor works you up and then decides what tests they want to run based on your symptoms, because it's their license on the line. 

Also, what kind of head CT? With contrast? Without? A CTA? Heck, a brain perfusion? Or maybe they want an MRI. And as the patient, how do you know which of these things are best in the moment based on your symptoms? I certainly don't. It's why I'm not a doctor. And it'd be pointless to run a cheaper test if it gave you no answers. That's throwing away money. 

Healthcare is a shit show but this isn't how to solve it, just gives you false expectations on price since the protocol for your exam varies widely based on location, radiologist, doctor, etc. Be mad at insurance companies and administration for this, not the clinical staff who want to help.
	 comment 8: I think this could work for outpatient procedure pricing. If your primary tells you it’s time for your colonoscopy or tells you that you’ll need an AXR for your back pain before further work up, you can easily shop around for those. Maybe an app like this could be helpful in limited scope.
	comment 9: There are a few such tools already like [turquoise.health](https://turquoise.health) and [trybilly.app](https://trybilly.app). But in my experience of trying them out, they each have their own problems.

Do you get access to that through an employer?
	comment 14: It would be nearly impossible. Costs vary by who your insurance coverage is.     If you don’t have insurance consider finding a direct primary care doctor.  Costs around $100 a month no insurance no copays no wait.  These are primary care doctors that don’t want to work with insurance companies.  Mine gets me labs at labcorp ar her cost which is at most 20% of normal costs.  For care other than your primary care doctor ask for the self pay rate.  It’s a fraction of what you will pay with insurance.   Trust me 40 years in the industry
	 comment 15: Would love your perspective having time in the industry. Mind if I PM?
	comment 16: It exists already. Surest has a mobile tool that does this. Starting 1/1, all plans will publish this data on their website. (Federal Mandate)

	 comment 18: Isn’t this limited to UHC plans?
	comment 19: Are you looking at an average ER visit without insurance? If you have insurance, go to an in-network hospital and you'll save money. But it depends on the contacted rates for the plan.
	comment 20: There’s a HHS rule called transparency in coverage which requires that all plan post their prices in machine readable formats online. Problem is that those machine readable files are not consumer friendly and can’t be downloaded typically by a normal computer. 

However this rule also requires plans have a self-service tool to allow beneficiaries to look up the cost of services online through their portal. So you should be able to see the price of these services if you look them up through this tool on your plans website while logged into your account. It should incorporate your out of pocket costs as well. 


There are start ups that others have mentioned in this thread like turquoise, health care blue book, ect. That are just beginning to use the data posted in the plans machine readable files to allow consumers to look up the prices of services but as others have mentioned these are still being developed. 

Creating an app or a tool would be a great idea. It’s new data and the perfect time to invest in this. The data will only get better as HHS puts out new rules to improve the format for the files. There is also the hospital price transparency rule as well which requires hospitals to post their pricing information by plan for shoppable services. 

The House is planning on codifying these rules through the Lower Cost More Transparency Act.
	comment 21: I’d recommend a DPC doctor if your are trying to watch costs. They’ll do that work for you.
	comment 22: Yes. Do it.
	comment 23: It’s also can be very misleading. Some of the larger institutions have the most generous charity care plans. The price patients pay is also highly dependent on what insurance they have (and the contract that the insurance have with the hospital). If you do this, there should be a big caveat about it being the posted/publicly available price from the organization’s charge master. I also think NPR or someone has attempted to do this already, but I highly encourage you to try and make it better!

I refuse to see a NP and have found in my area, they are charing the same as a seeing a real doctor.  Crazy that anyone pays the same for substandard expertise.
	comment 31: Yes, and everyone should have access to it and reference it if they're being referred for special procedures. If the cheaper options aren't on your insurance PPO, call customer service and find out why.
	comment 32: Stand alone radiology clinics not affiliated with hospitals are around 1/10th of hospital charges.   My direct care primary care physician sends an order and a mammogram costs me about $150.  In Chicago there’s a radiology center called Bright Light.  A direct primary care physician usually can direct you to these types of solutions.   Many companies are getting wise to the insurance company games, ditching networks and paying cash up front based on a percentage of Medicare charges and implementing direct primary care for their employees.  I’ve seen it save companies  50% of their companies healthcare spend.  Companies in turn do away with deductibles and copays so their employees get the care they need. Individuals can tap into these solutions.  Direct primary care physicians are changing the game.  Google it.  You should be able to find them in most areas.  Mine went to Duke for medical school.

Post 5: Should l report my doctor to the hospital?
	comment 1: It sounds like she counseled you about smoking cessation, birth control, and risks. You need to do your part and stop smoking.
	 comment 2: Agreed. If you were over 35 or had some other type or heart disease or risk factors then I would agree with not prescribing certain OCPs. I don’t think that prescription is unreasonable and it’s likely that she was just counseling you on cessation- albeit doing so in perhaps a way they made OP feels judged. 

The PT prior to MRI and surgical referral are also appropriate, a lot of times these do improve with conservative treatment, although in a perfect world patients especially those with neurological deficits i.e weakness/numbness should receive an MRI sooner. This is predominately dictated by insurance, unfortunately. You should absolutely feel frustrated that it took so long to get an MRI. There is also something to be said for scheduling the MRI itself. The onus doesn’t entirely rely with the physician here. Not to say it never does, however most times delays in care are brought about by insurance companies predominately concerned with money, not your health. 


At the end of the day you got the help you needed, it seems. Either way, it’s clear that you don’t trust or feel cared for appropriately by this doctor. I think it’s reasonable to get a new doctor, but I don’t think they did anything terribly inappropriate.
	comment 3: The thing is… when it comes to back pain and herniated discs, there isn’t anything (good) that standard of care medicine can do for you. There is no drug or procedural fix.  That’s why there are tens of millions disabled with musculoskeletal conditions.
	 comment 4: I did get surgery, and im totally fine now. I feel like she held me back from getting surgery, having to wait 3 months for an mri was ridiculous. She resents me for being a disabled miserable vegetable because i was in tears for every appointment, and i cant help but feel like she hates me.
	comment 5: So, I lost the use of my right arm. I'm young and relatively healthy overall. My job is incredibly dependent on said arm. I couldn't pick up a glass of water, or a pen. Holy hell it hurt. My doctor ordered an urgent MRI. I got my appointment time in the mail quite promptly.....it was 11 months from my doctors appointment. That was for an urgent MRI.

It was unpleasant. I survived. I've also had about 37 surgeries in my life and experienced some pretty insane levels of pain. I was never mean or lashed out at any of my healthcare providers though, but I wasn't afraid to stand up for myself, firmly and politely, when I needed something or didn't like the care.

Healthcare is not instantaneous, especially for a non-life threatening condition (which pretty much includes anything musculoskeletal). Does it suck? Yup. 

A doctor is a human being, and it is a very difficult job. I won't lie, if a patient repeatedly came to appointments and acted as a "disabled miserable vegetable" when I was doing whatever I could in my professional capacity for them, the occasional facial expression slip may occur.

Is it professional, no. But human. If you dislike the doctor, than find another one that you find more compatibility with. I don't know her, so she may be a horrible doctor personality wise, I have no idea. But, medically wise - she sounds like she is doing the standard healthcare and getting you the care you need (in a very short period of time actually).

As for birth control medications. Nexplanon also increases your risk of heart attacks, blood clots and strokes, especially in those over the age of 35 and women who smoke. I'm not an expert in all the hormonal birth control methods out there, but as far as I know, that's a standard potential side effect of every hormonal birth control out there.

Tylenol can kill you if used incorrectly. 

It may make sense to see a gynecologist though, as I do find a lot of female reproductive issues are not taken as seriously as they should be in young women (just what I have personally seen in my career). So, it is fair to request a referral or appointment, and get more information about what options you have. Especially if you are not comfortable with taking the hormones. As an aside, risk does increase over the age of 35 but you are a long ways away from 35 at this point, and you didn't have an adverse reaction to the Nexplanon, so all of that works in your favor. Smoking is your choice, and I would be more concerned about lung cancer and COPD personally, over the hormonal birth control, but I'm a practical person that way.

It sounds like she has not been providing you with the appropriate care and has even prescribed medication that could be dangerous for you given your smoking habit. It's important to advocate for your own health and well-being, and reporting her actions can help prevent similar mistreatment of other patients in the future.

	comment 1: Hey OP I’m a licensed health insurance advisor so I may be able to help. You can dispute that bill. First ask them for an itemized list of everything being changed. Most times just with doing that I see the bill go down. After that you can ask them for a payment plan and when the first bill comes in the mail you can dispute it. Since your wife makes that much if you guys are on an ACA marketplace plan I’m sure the premium is pretty high. You should look into getting a private insurance plan that is not based on you income. If you have any other questions or need help let me know

	comment 10: Charity care programs are an option depending on how much the family income is. For those who make more than that, I recommend getting a professional to take a look to make sure the benefits are correctly applied. 

So for family of two, the federal poverty limit put you just under $20,000. That means, if you earned nothing this year, or even got a little u employment, you’d get maybe a 25% discount or so. I’d actually fight for a 35% discount if you’re able.

Post 10: Received large bill for medical procedure
	comment 1: * in checking with my insurance, the provider never contacted my insurer for a benefits check prior to the procedure*

The point where they asked you about doing this to get a better sense of things, and what you thought was the point where you were supposed to ask how much this was going to cost and whether our insurance might cover any of it.  They expected you to say Hey, how much is this going to cost me? And is this covered by my insurance? Some offices/ providers are better at these things than others. 

There aren't any laws or codes requiring that you be told when there's going to be a separate charge for the endoscopy that you already agreed to. There really isn't any recourse either. I mean you can complain, but I wouldn't expect any real change out of it.
	 comment 2: Yeah that’s kinda what I figured. Basically just an expensive mistake and valuable lesson to always ask what the impact will be financially.
	comment 3: It is your responsibility as the consumer to know your benefits.  All plans are different and have varying benefits. It would be impossible for the provider to accurately quote benefits.  They would have to call your insurance provider on your behalf. Also, office visit copays oftentimes only cover the cost of the visit charge but not any additional services like labs, X-rays , tests and procedures.  Sometimes you pay the copay and also must meet the deductible before the plan pays.  Benefits are very specific to your plan.  It’s also your responsibility to verify if your provider is in or out of network.
	 comment 4: Yeah I guess the issue isn’t so much that I didn’t know me benefits (I feel like I actually know them fairly well), so much as I want aware that the endoscopy was perceived to be a “separate” treatment that would be billed differently. Like I’m used to X-rays snd MRIs being a separate charge…but that’s like a whole thing…you leave the room…bla bla bla. In this case it felt more like them just using some standard tool that would (and maybe why I’m paying a higher specialist copay to begin with). It’s not like you would expect to see a separate charge when a doc takes your blood pressure…..this felt the same, ya know?
	comment 5: I saw a bunch of ENTs before my sinus surgery in April.  All but one of them had the endoscopy covered as part of the specialist co-pay.  The one that was not ended up being a $1,500 bill.  Come to find out they were in a "hospital" office.  Looked like a normal office to me.  Anyways, lots of fighting and I finally got to someone that gave me 50% off to just pay it off.  So, yeah... you gotta find the "gotcha" why it was not part of the co-pay.  And then avoid that office.
	 comment 6: Interesting — so maybe worth 20 minutes of pretending to be extremely angry on the phone and probing why it wasn’t included in the copay?
	comment 7: Diagnostic nasal endoscopy is a legitimate procedure and has a separate CPT code (billing code) used to specify what was done to an insurance company. In an ideal world the ENT doc would have made it clear to you that performing this procedure would generate an additional charge, separate from the office visit charge. Some ENT docs might make that clear, some not - I'm not aware of any law about this. And the procedure was 'covered' by your insurance, the fact that you had not fulfilled your deductible is unfortunate but that's the way your insurance works.

There is no easy way to know if some procedure done in an office during a regular visit will generate a separate bill other than by asking. Tell everybody you see, including the Doc, "I'm short on cash right now so please let me know if anything you do will have a separate charge beyond the office visit". 

I saw a dermatologist who mentioned I had a 'red spot' on my forehead and would I like them to zap it with a puff of liquid nitrogen? I said, 'why not' and the 'treatment' took about 3-4 seconds, and generated a bill of about $1000 for a surgical procedure. Who knew that ''cryotherapy' would be separately billed when the canister of liquid nitrogen was on the counter and it took a few seconds of the doc's time? Now I know. 

I don't think this is a 'bug' in the system, I think it IS the system.
	 comment 8: Yeah your experience sounds about like my experience. I guess it is what it is and a good learning lesson. In the scheme of things 500 bucks is irrelevant and I’m glad it wasn’t 5000. 

Just pisses me off. Next thing we know we will start to see these separate bills for when they take our blood pressure at the start of every apt
	comment 9: The provider really doesn’t do much insurance wise. Except for something like a prior authorization. I promise your doctor knows shit about medical insurance. 

Now that being said, this is someone responsibility in the office, but not your doctors. 

That being said there is no recourse. It is considered by the insurance to be as much your responsibility as the offices to check. Is it not fair? Yep, but that’s the way healthcare works in this country.
	comment 10: Did your EOB state you owe that amount ornwas the bill from your provider?

Taxes do suck, and there are flaws in the system, but I do like knowing that if something goes horribly wrong I likely won't go bankrupt.

	comment 13: In order to be considered human, one must first be born, because only after birth does the infant acquire sufficient autonomy to be a separate living being. Neither the embryo nor the fetus can be aware - and, therefore, experience - pain. A woman who decides to have an abortion does not hurt anyone but herself. From 40 to 60% of the embryos are not able to develop due to genetic errors, therefore, they are subjected to "natural" abortion. Medical abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy is a procedure that is the “direct successor” of biological processes that are already going on in a woman’s body.
	 comment 14: The baby has a beating heart within 7 weeks which makes it alive, it's illegal to have an abortion over that.
	 comment 15: I am pretty much sure, during the first week, when it's like just a couple of sells, the only one who is going to feel pain is me, and my wallet.
	comment 16: This is awesome

I wasn’t looking for this, and found it by clicking a link in another thread.  I don’t need it, but I am definitely saving this in case I or anyone else ever does.

This is so important.

Aye these Draconian psychopaths are slicing away at the rights of women for bodliy autonomy nothing stops them from doing the same to the rights of other peoples too.

Remember there are still part of the country where it is legal to genitally mutilate a child. Numerous children go through it everyday.

The 'gubmint' has sliced away at the bodily autonomy rights of children who clearly don't have the right to consent whether they are circumcised or not.

They are doing hthe same damned thing here, slicing away with abandon at the bodily autonomy rights of women who want to remain childfree or are suffering from ectopic pregnancies or just don't want to have a child at this time!

	comment 29: This just became so much more important
	comment 30: I don't care about this issue exactly. I care about human freedom. This is part of that. But I like to get to the fundamental first. If you give proper freedom then abortion is a default.

	comment 44: The satanic temple managed to keep abortion an option through religious freedom laws? Those guys are the real deal haha. Fight fire with fire.
	 comment 45: Actual OG move right there. I'm proud of them.
	 comment 46: The Satanic Temple is a scam and cannot get you an abortion. They also can't bypass state restrictions. If you need help accessing an abortion, you're better off contacting The National Network Of Abortion Funds, Aid Access, Plan C Pills, National Abortion Federation... There's tons of legitimate resources out there. Don't waste your time on a group that's more concerned with "owning conservatives" and becoming a living meme, than actually helping people. I say that as someone that is a Satanist and previously affiliated myself with them.
	comment 47: I used many of these links to start a fake travel blog that is actually a repository of bodily autonomy resources, and credited you in one of the pages for your legwork.

Post 2: endless online misogyny
	comment 1: The people commenting normally have no lives, I've just left those spaces where such horrible comments are liked (reels, shorts, tiktok etc.) as it seems like the lowest of the low flock to those sites. So now i just use reddit, sure there's neckbeards sometimes but they're definitely not as terrible as the horrible tik tok comments.
	comment 2: Yeah I see it too, it makes me so depressed honestly. Women are non-humans to them somehow. Idk if its the Tate effect or they just project their inability to find a romantic partner to hatred for us. It is so upsetting.

Post 3: Teen girls are being victimized by deepfake nudes. One family is pushing for more protections
	comment 1: Deepfaked pornography is so disgusting and devastating. My heart goes out to these poor victims, I hope they can get some justice
	comment 2: Federal Government MUST make the penalties for explicitly nonconsensual ai deepfake pornography a criminal offense, with all of the same consequences as all other sex crimes. They should need to register as sex offenders, lose access to the internet, jailtime, etc. And if the victim is a minor, then they should be criminalized like people who are caught with CP, where every individual frame of the generated ai pornography counts as an individual image, so freaks can be charged with having 100,000+ (for example) CP images, or 100,000 frames of revenge porn. 


And to note: explicitly nonconsensual means, any person being portrayed in a sexual deepfake who hasnt signed a specific legally binding contract. If this documentation cant be provided, then the individual who creates the deepfake should be criminally charged by the terms mentioned above. 


The penalties must be this harsh, we need to scare these freaks, and make examples of the first few charged by throwing the entire fu*king book at them, and these investigations should be conducted by the fbi to assure maximum thoroughness and penalty.
	comment 3: If legislators dont take actionn, then perhaps the next course of action is making deepfakeed intense gay porn, of any mann who publicly supportss this. Since they claim its “free speech” lets see how they like it rightt? By their argument thats ok, and we shouldd make intense deepfaked ai porn where that man is shown bottomingg to protect our first amendment right!
	 comment 4: Mutually assured destruction, I like it!
	comment 5: Not only women but also men r victims of this crime

Post 4: In 40 states child marriage is legal
	comment 1: Gosh, I feel so sorry for all the children coerced into marriages. I’ve read some stories by women who had to marry and live with their offenders, it’s inhumane. The US law is such a shit show 🤦🏼‍♀️
	comment 2: I went to look this up. Apparently there are 5 states with no minimum age for marriage which is absolutely criminal. The other 35 have 16 or 17 as minimum age with parental consent which is pretty normal in the modern world

Post 5: How do I explain the misogynistic nature of calling a women “domineering” because her personality is non conforming to typical gender roles within a hetero relationship?
	comment 1: You do not need to suck up your discomfort, nor waste your time and mental energy on this misogynist. Block and ignore him, and refuse to be around him. He is not healthy for you, he does not care about you, you will not change his mind.

Your bf, on the other hand, should have had your back this whole time. When he refuses to end friendships with misogynistic men who demean and insult you, he is giving his tacit approval of their behavior. Your bf’s disrespect is astounding, really. 

If it were me, I would consider this a dealbreaker. You deserve someone who won’t be friends with people who say awful, misogynistic things about you.

Post 6: The Language of Women
	comment 1: I think, the easiest way to learn "woman language" is listening to women, reading books written by women and watch movies made by women.

Communication is a cultural thing and while women are obviously part of the mainstream culture, they live a different reality which reflects in language. Women are usually not so blunt, more subtle, use more body language, ... I am always stunned when men don't catch when women don't like each other. They so seldom notice antipathy in women.
	comment 2: [Deborah Tannen](https://www.deborahtannen.com/) has written a lot about the differences in how men and women communicate. I highly recommend: 

[You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation](https://www.deborahtannen.com/you-just-dont-understand)

[Talking From 9 to 5: Women and Men at Work](https://www.deborahtannen.com/talking-from-9-to-5)

I also recommend Rebecca Solnit, who coined the term "mansplaining." [Men Explain Things to M](http://rebeccasolnit.net/book/men-explain-things-to-me/)e is sooooo good. She has written other books about language and gender, but I haven't read them. 

[Women and Power](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631494758) by Mary Beard is an interesting look at how women's speech has been limited historically in the "western" world. 

I also recommend reading/watching media made for and made by women. Female authors, female film makers, female artists, etc.
	comment 3: Excellent scholarly tomes here.  Occasionally you may want a palate cleanser.

The series "Julia" is a great primer on the subtle language women use.  Watch it once, and then watch it again -- the second time through, pay attention to gesture, expression, tone.

When Avis talks to Paul she is speaking the language of men: blunt, clear, short sentences.  When she talks to Alice, she is considerate, subtle, and frequently wordless.  A simple nod with a tiny curtsey in season 2 conveys "I'm apologize, I see what I loaded you up with, look how I humbled myself with this silly thing, I'm glad to do it because you deserve better, and I'll be doing my job from now on so you can do yours... all of yours, none of ours. "  It's a single second but the gesture conveys a paragraph's conversation.  Avis' conversations are nearly always layered and complex.  For instance, she'll juxtapose a kind tone against harsh words, and that combined with a welcoming gesture conveys how hard her day has been, how much she is grieving, and that she welcomes company.

It is not a perfect example of all of women's conversation.  The lack of codeswitching by Alice and her family is jarring by its absence.  But nothing is perfect, eh?
	comment 4: I have had to learn to speak to men. I think female conversations are more inclusive and communal. That and men try to solve the problem when often just want to be heard. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Woman: should we stop and get coffee? ( it means: I want to stop and get coffee, do you want to get coffee to?)

Man: I want to stop and get coffee.
	comment 5: I’ve got something even better than books and such. 

I’ve got an experiment you can conduct!

Wherever you are that you can hear women talking (and *particularly* when they’re talking to men), listen to how they phrase their statements of need or want—especially if it’s something they need or want, not a request on behalf of someone else (like their child). 

You’ll probably find that their language often trends toward being less direct and more suggestive. (For instance, instead of saying “I hate/resent” something, it will be expressed as “I don’t like it when….” Or “I would rather you not….”)
	comment 6: [https://www.gottman.com/blog/what-do-women-really-want/](https://www.gottman.com/blog/what-do-women-really-want/)

Learning to *accept influence* from women (Gottman) is a key ingredient, this is something most women do well. Active listening is important, most people listen to respond, not to understand. 

Our language is everywhere in many things, you have to remove the patriarchal filter to hear and learn. 

Cheers!

	comment 9: From what I undestand her point is that there is no Language of Women, because women learn the o ly one available and functional: the male one.

Post 7: I feel devastated(south korea)
	comment 1: I'm so sorry for your circumstances, hon. Unfortunately there's been a huge, patriarchal push-back since the "me too" and subsequent "black lives matter" movements, at least in the West, but it could be a global thing (in the internet age.)
	 comment 2: Agreed.
	comment 3: I only recently learned that being a feminist  - and specifically being a woman in S Korean saying that youre a feminist - is basically social suicide for celebrities. 

Crazy that saying "hey, women and men should have equal rights" isnt just frowned upon, but actively shut down. 

I feel like the hallyu wave has done a really good job of hiding how patriarchal and anti-woman the south korean society actually is.
	 comment 4: I heard about foreign women who fantasize about Korean men because of the Korean Wave... I hope they know about these things...😢
	comment 5: Yep, there is a big reason why I am choosing to live in the west for the rest of my life.
	 comment 6: me too, i naively thought when i was younger travelling/living around the world would be something that was safe and possible for me to do. But now i know it'd be hell as a woman. It'd just be harassment, questionable looks and genuinely unsafe. It just makes me sad that the hand I was dealt at birth means that I'll be looked down upon and mistreated by many regardless of my actions. 

So I will keep my ass firmly stamped in a western country where i feel safer to be alone and single + do what I want as a woman.
	comment 7: Girl I'm Korean and I totally agree with you. I have no hopes for the men in thsi country. They are delusional and insane as fuck. I'm trying to get out of this country if possible or not, i'd choose to live alone forever. What the actual fuck is this? Am I living in the middle age?
	comment 8: Yeah I saw that. It’s like these people don’t realize the thumb and index finger are next to each other. They were pulling any screen shot where a thumb got anywhere near the index finger fr. Do they expect every character to have their hands splayed at all time? Even in the in between shots??? Even if it was on purpose. Don’t people in Korea call women over 25/30 Christmas leftovers or something?? and make fun of women for literally anything they do? They give validity to the little dick allegations by getting so mad. I wish people would use the symbol more now tbh
	comment 9: Get out of that country if possible
	comment 10: I am also a Korean woman. This country is crazy...
	comment 11: My wife is a Korean woman, and we have been together for a long time. She is sympathetic to feminist philosophy and more gender affirmational thinking. But she is terrified to speak of these views to anyone but me for fear of castigation and ostracization. Women are blamed for all of Koreas ills, it seems. 

And just as an aside, I have seen how a lack of feminism has hurt both men and women in this country.  Relationships and marriages remain largely performances, by both partners. Women are expected to sacrifice their careers (flushing years of educational toil down the shitter) to become wives, mothers, and caretakers. Men for their part are expected to be breadwinners and do manly jobs, and those that stray from the mold are ostracized.
	comment 12: Can you please give context - I've no clue which issue you're talking about?!

Post 8: Am I overreacting or is this sexist…
	comment 1: They're trying to get you to work for free in their marketing department. Keep refusing to bite.
	comment 2: Sexist - absolutely. 

But the way they responded to you? Just from that I can tell they'll hang themselves. 
Because now others will go on there and take the quiz to see what answers they get - and they'll see what you saw right off.

Like I said - they're quickly hanging themselves and don't even know it.
	comment 3: This is both sexist and exploitative. But unfortunately par for the course for social media. Controversy and outrage drives engagement.
	comment 4: LOL, what a lazy attempt at marketing. I‘m sure this “quiz” doesn’t even take your responses into consideration with their gift recommendations. If you choose mom, they recommend some “mom stuff”, if you choose dad, they recommend some “dad stuff”. It’s a sham, like virtually all other quiz-based things you come across online. They do it because it increases engagement, because people like quizzes. Then they use reactions like yours as fodder for more outrage bait, using red flags like “we’re being canceled because sexism” — which is why they want you to do a video. They hope to generate even more outrage and conflict, to get more engagement.

I hope you realize you played right into their hands by complaining to them. They’re right, other companies do it too, and for the same reason — to provoke a reaction from someone, which they can use to get more clicks. Even your post here only serves to potentially drive more engagement, despite you not mentioning the thing by name, if anyone goes looking for this dumb quiz out of curiosity. Next time you come across some stupidly obvious sexism in marketing content, I think it’s better to recognize it’s just outrage bait, close the page, and look for gift ideas elsewhere.
	comment 5: The biggest give away here is that they keep asking you to respond via social media (specifically social media that spreads fast, with lots of interactions but shallow engagement).   

If that doesn’t scream “Do our marketing job for us” I don’t what does.    

Just ignore them.
	comment 6: Absolutely sexist. They clearly just the use prompts as filters and have tags associating cleaning products with mums.

The fact they’re trying to scream cancel culture to boost their signal also tells you who they’re trying to boost it to.
	comment 7: Sexist and also just s\*\*t people.
	comment 8: Sexist, bad marketing, annoying gimmick... what an awful company. You aren't overreacting. The whole quiz is probably rage bait.
	comment 9: Yeah it’s sexist and they also want your marketing services for free

Feel free to make a TikTok video that does not name them or show who they are

If they want to name them or show who they are then they can fix their algorithm and they can pay you seriously big bucks

Post 3: Barbara Creed's "The Monstrous-Feminine" and Wildbow's dual serials Worm and Ward

Post 4: Books to give an anti-feminist
	comment 1: ***Feminism is for Everybody*** **by bell hooks** comes to mind. 

It's geared towards people new to feminism, it's relatively short, and it addresses a lot of misconceptions of feminism as well as the common pitfalls of feminist practice. The downside is that it's very much hooks' opinions rather than the best introduction to feminist theory. There are quite a few radical feminists who think this is among her worst work, that she's too moderate and conformist. Many think that she became too much of a hippie in her later career. 

***The Will to Change*** **by bell hooks** might be better, although it's longer and a bit headier. 

Bell hooks speaks about men and masculinity in particular and how misogyny hurts men and women alike. Again, this book is a bit controversial among feminist theorists because it calls for increased empathy and other compassion to be given to men in order to further feminism as a whole. Your brothers might find it a bit eye-rolling in its optimism but I know a lot of men who've found it helpful in forming their masculinity, even if hooks is a bit of a hippie. 


***Adam's Return*** **by Fr. Richard Rohr** isn't feminist theory, but I'd still recommend it for your brothers. 

Speaking of hippies, Rohr is a controversial Franciscan priest because his worldview flirts with a lot of New Age beliefs and folkways. This book is geared towards men and those who're trying to understand their masculinity. It's not feminist and outright states that it's not a feminist text but it offers a scaffolding for embracing masculinity without compromising one's conscience. It's well-loved outside of Catholicism and Christianity since it speaks of broader universal cultural archetypes.
	 comment 2: Thank you so much! I'll definitely check them out!
	comment 3: they probably won't read it tho :/
	 comment 4: Yeah...he will probably throw feminist books away.
	comment 5: I would have suggested Simone de Beauvoir's "The Second Sex" but you want something more introductory DK's The Feminism Book, Introducing Feminism A Graphic Guide etc
	 comment 6: Thank you, I'll be sure to check them out!
	comment 7: I grew up in a home where feminism was a priority, most days I felt like my mom valued my sisters input more than my dads when it came to raising me, it didn’t help that I was basically expected to be my sisters emotional chew toy on her bad days. I have no idea what your home was like, but if you’re serious about helping them lose their resentment towards feminism, id try and learn where the root of their anger comes from by asking them why they feel the way they do, and being open to the answer, chances are they don’t understand the root of it themselves. Best of luck and happy holidays.

Post 5: Where can I find this phrase?
	comment 1: I only found the phrase used in the Schutte article you mentioned and [this other paper](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/12145/pdf) which doesn’t seem related. 
In cases like this sometimes I find the authors are translating the phrases themselves, which is typically noted somewhere in the article.
	 comment 2: Thank you for checking as well, I appreciate the assistance. That could be it. At first I thought, the reference may have been mixed up with another book that's why I checked "The Sex Which is Not One" but it could be a self-translation though I didn't find a relating note. I'll just clarify in a footnote that it may have been directly translated from the original French version.  
Thank you very much though!

Post 6: Calling All Women!! 💄
	comment 1: More safe spaces to be in movement. Women's gyms, dance groups, self defense classes etc. Women need safe spaces to be in movement and connection with their own bodies and eachother without being sexualized, objectified or targeted by perpetrators. Also women's self defense/martial arts classes. It's far too triggering for many women to be in self defense classes that require them to touch/fight/be in contact with men. 

Also women's classes on maintenance/repair/skills etc that are traditionally reserved for men. I'd love to be able to learn how to work on my car in a safe space.
	comment 2: I want an app that can connect any woman in the home with a live, eloquent, “I’ve got your back no matter what” feminist.


They are on 24/7 chat and they’re there to:

1. Tell you you’re not crazy
2.  Prepare an argument on your behalf 
3. Give any general support and provide resources
4. Be an unconditional source for you: If you want someone to believe your experience without questioning or qualifying 
5. Pull quotes from feminist texts IMMEDIATELY to be thrown like throwing stars ✨ when needed
	comment 3: I really want a woman owned, women led, women researched CHAIN of auto mechanics.



Right now I have to always bring some shmuck with me to the mechanic shop so they don’t automatically assume I’m an idiot and lie to me about issues and prices.

I want a woman I can trust and there’s no reason why women can’t be excellent mechanics.

In fact I’d pay a premium for honesty and safety and to avoid men when I’m getting my car fixed
	comment 4: Clothing stores that carry larger sizes that don't have names that make fun of large people.
	comment 5: I want every organization employing more than 20 women to have ON SITE DAYCARE AND BEFORE AND AFTER CARE or ELSE provide Childcare as a mandated work benefit - period.

	comment 1: Hahah! Thanks for the laugh.
All races are racist against blacks? And ONLY that happens?
You realize everyone deals with it, even whites. As A Native American myself, you know, the ones who were forced out of our homes to live in designated prisons, This is just fkkng stupid.

Edit: I misread the article. My bad. I thought it was talking about the other way around lol
	 comment 2: I keep reading this and laughing about how you bring up something no one alive today had anything to do with.....Why blame dead people and those not involved?
	comment 3: Now see that's where your stupid racism is in EVERY RACE white against black , black against white , native American against whites....the list goes on and on!!!!! In fact America is the only country that supports hatred towards whites from every race!!!! Just look at the media you don't see anything about a black officer killing a white person but if a white cop kills a black person watch out its racism!!!! Anything else you wanna say?????
As am after thought you didn't even read my original post where I said ots in ALL races!!!!
A little history lesson as well... whites were slaves and persecuted thousands of years before anybody else in egypt.
Also just to clear things up I'm not racist in the least I judge every person by their own actions and attitudes you could be green and purple for all I care...of you show me respect I do the same. If you dont like the way your treated maybe its your attitude?
	 comment 4: 1. the jewish people were not white

2. yes, there is racism to and against all races.  that doesnt make the sufferings equal though

3. you are likely not outwardly prejudiced, but it is ignorant to say you have no racial bias and treat everyone equally. this is because most racism is subconscious to the point where we dont notice it even if were looking for it.

Post 3: I’m leaving healthcare to go back to the barista life. These last 3 months have been Hell.
	comment 1: Wow. I'm sorry. What a nightmare.  
There is such a shortage of healthcare workers these days and this is a big part of the reason why.  And it sucks.

Life is too short to invest your time and energy into a job that makes you miserable. There is absolutely no shame in recognizing that and moving forward in a way that is happy and healthy for you.  Sounds to me like the life you'd be going back to is pretty darn appealing!
	 comment 2: I can say I took a part-time job at a bank abandoning my pharmacy career because despite 3 years of amazing evaluations, spotlight shout-outs from district managers and patients about my above and beyond care and performance I never got a pay-raise. I worked so much overtime during covid I was able to buy a house at a training rate of 16.50 an hour and when I got promoted to Senior Tech/Lead Pharmacy Technician and hit 20$ an hour I never got an increase since. We were an invisible force working during covid and everyone respected the nurses and doctors and emts… but us pharmacy folks were out there off site immunizing communities (myself have administered thousands of vaccines as just a technician). We would catch covid from patients just as much and go down in entire teams like dominoes. 
  
But no pay raises. Eventually after so many responsibilities being added and so many expectations and still no pay raises I had enough and I just left.

	comment 4: I work in financial services. My firm handles the majority of the 401(k) accounts. So I talk to everybody and I mean EVERYBODY. I have spoken to many workers in many fields over my long career. Far and away the MOST miserable I’ve met worked at dialysis clinics.
	 comment 5: I believe it... if you are on dialysis then you are in a bad way so the patients are really, very sick. Also I hear the industry is super corrupt, a lot of private markets and money (and like OP said, cutting corners) in dialysis.

The whole industry probably need way more oversight and regulation but who's going to fight that battle and why?
	 comment 6: What fields stood out to you as the happiest? Any others that stood out as miserable?
	comment 7: If you really want to stay in the dialysis field, see if you can get yourself into a home dialysis program. I don't know if your colleagues would be any different from your in-center colleagues but your patients will be. And you won't have them dying on you left and right.
	 comment 8: Or just home care visits especially since you have the oncology background.   Yes there is paperwork but, once off orientation it’s just you and the patient that you can focus on.
	comment 9: My ex worked at Davita and he is an incredibly hard worker, quiet, and never complained. I worked with him at a previous job (restaurant) and fell for him because of his dedication to whatever he was focused on. Devita treated him like shit and he quit, and he had worked other jobs (bussing, electrician journeyman work shoved into tight FL attics at 100++ degrees, machine shops where he came home covered in machine dust particles) and I've never seen him falter. Devita sucked the life out of him.
	 comment 10: Watch John Oliver’s documentary on dialysis companies about DaVita. It’s on YouTube. https://youtu.be/yw_nqzVfxFQ?si=YavtOT7UQJqnkzbS
	 comment 11: I’ve hired nurses from Davita. During the interviews, you can tell their spirit is so broken and seem defeated by life in general. I tell them to not let this experience determine their whole concept with nursing.  The Davita business model is so inhumane. I don’t know how they expect they can treat their employees like crap and have great results with the patient’s.  SMH.
	comment 12: I'm so sorry. I'm in my early 30s and spent the last 10 years in hospitality management and burned out so badly.

This story is tragic cause OP lives in one of the best regions of the US to be an RN (SoCal) and all these misinformed/misleading comments are dissuading her from pursuing nursing school
	comment 20: I am speaking as a very burned out healthcare worker: if you have it in you to get your qualification, try do so before you make any big decisions. Pop it in your back pocket before you step awau and you can see if the itch to return to clinical work comes for you again. If it does you can tweak where you work and what hours you do. If it doesn't you can prove academic and transferable skills whatever else you choose to do in the future. At least you won't have nagging what ifs.

But ultimately your health is the mpst important thing, too many places rely on staff going above and beyond to keep minimum service provision limping along.
	comment 21: Healthcare is one of those fields where there’s a really high prevalence of “in order to be good in this field, you need to break the rookies and rebuild them in your image”. It’s incredibly toxic and causes so many promising people to leave the field. Sounds like you got one of these.

There are very few careers as mentally, emotionally and to an extent physically demanding as nursing. Anyone who goes through it and comes out the other side not broken is extremely rare.

Best of luck in whatever you choose!
	 comment 22: Then anyone who wants to be an xray tech and have a good internship in my immediate area needs to do it now. I personally know two *senior* techs, as in retiring in the next two yrs, who work really hard to build up their students and teach them the "not in the books" tricks of the trade. Every student that comes into their department wants to shadow these two guys.
	 comment 23: This was my experience in the ER as a medic.  I had to “prove” myself.  On my first day, one RN said “great, another YOUNG GIRL.” For the first few months another was always on my ass about orders that I had already completed.  About a year in I became lead tech and everyone was bummed when I left four years later.  What a joke!
	 comment 24: This reminds me of a very good BBC TV show based on the experience of a doctor who wrote a book called This Is Going To Hurt. It’s actually quite a funny show, it uses a Fleabag-like narration where he breaks the fourth wall to share his thoughts because he uses dark humour to cope with the stressful situations. 

One of the senior doctor characters perfectly embodies the viewpoint of one of those people who thinks they’re giving ‘tough love’ but in actuality is being brutal. Spoiler for an important part of the show, so if you’re going to watch it don’t read this: >!There’s a character called Shruti who is a student doctor at the start of the show. She meets with a senior doctor and tells her how awful she’s finding it and how depressed it’s making her, and the senior doctor essentially tells her “it’s always going to be this hard, if you’re whining about it then you’re clearly not cut out for this and you should quit.” Shruti carries on, finds out she’s passed her exams to become a fully qualified doctor and then kills herself.!<
	 comment 25: My niece literally just started and noped out of nursing after seeing what a toxic environment it is with the older nurses shitting on the younger ones, various cliques and all round unpleasant work environment..
	comment 26: I’m sorry for the hell you’ve been through. If you’re in the U.S. I’m sure you know by now that out of the entire shitshow that is our healthcare system, dialysis is one of the most unethically managed. The whole thing is deeply poisoned by the logic of capitalism, and dialysis patients are so starkly viewed as cashcows. 

I’m so sorry you’re being ground up in this system. I hope it helps a bit that whenever I meet someone  who tells me they’re something like a nurse, a teacher, a waiter or a barista, they rise in my esteem immediately. Anybody from another job has to jump through a hoop or two before they convince me that their job actually helps anyone. You sound rad!
	comment 27: We have millions of people with medical degrees who arent working in the field because hospitals and medical companies are so fucking shit at understaffing and hours, making the job miserable.
	 comment 28: Its the job where I feel things need to go as smoothly as possible and where there needs to be the most empathy.
	comment 29: I sympathize. You seem like someone especially good at what you do

Personally I do not believe anyone should be nursing in this country until the dynamic changes and respect becomes more so the norm. I could never understand how someone would work a job that at this point usually involves being completely shit on by the people you are serving -- be the patients or the hospital itself. Fuck all that noise -- you're too good for them, go back working something enjoyable
	comment 30: Correct me if this sounds wrong, but almost all of the problems you listed sound more like problems with people than problems with the work. Getting taken advantage of (peers taking long breaks), condescended (the lead's checklists), disrespected (the distance and cold shoulder), etc. are because your coworkers are jerks. And that can happen anywhere.

It's not your fault they suck and wanna be all jaded by the industry.  

It sounds to me like management likes you. I bet these toxic individuals know it and resent you for it. In reality, their behavior is their own choice and so too is their stagnation.
	 comment 31: Seconding this!
	comment 32: I used to be a dietitian in a dialysis clinic. The techs work so hard. I do think the employee quality of life can vary clinic to clinic but overall I felt dialysis was very depressing (bc it is) and after a year or two I was bored because of the repetitive nature of my job. I do think there is so much in healthcare you could explore that wouldn’t be as miserable but also respect your decision.
	comment 33: I went to nursing school. Where I went was absolute shit. They did what they could to kick as many people out as possible. If you didn’t play the social game, you didn’t get help. Fuck that noise. Then Covid hit. Thank god I didn’t make the cut.
	comment 34: As a PA in emergency medicine who is closing in on two years, you’re not alone. Healthcare is brutal, and from what I hear from seasoned nurses, it never used to be this bad. I am looked at as a number to move patients along. I’m met with patients who physically threaten me daily, and I am just expected to deescalate and continue on. I got an email yesterday from management that clocking in at the start of my shift is clocking in late. The fact that I even have to clock in at this stage in my career is asinine. If I could talk my younger self out of it, I would.
	comment 35: Your job was in a very specific niche healthcare setting. Don't judge all the potential jobs by that one! You have so many choices as an RN.
	 comment 36: Unfortunately I was raised by two nurses and a bunch of their friends would come over and chain smoke in our backyard after work and tell me to do anything but nursing lol. I already went into healthcare trying to ignore that and stay positive but honestly the hours and stress surrounding nursing school alone seem hellacious. I get what you’re saying though, ty
	 comment 37: Sadly it’s the same anywhere. I work at a care home. The bullying and harassment is so intense I’ve called in sick for every shift there the last three or so months and I’ve cried almost every shift I’ve worked 🙃
	 comment 38: You can also find work in healthcare administration companies and insurers is you ever want to do white collar work.

I know the perception is that working for an insurer will mean denying care, but there’s so many other types of roles. Ex. Case management and chronic disease interventions. If you want to earn more with less stress it’s something to look into.
	comment 39: Same experience in education.  I'm a licensed teacher working as a "low status" paraprofessional at a charter school.  Per hour I make the same as I would as an exempt teacher but instead of endless meetings, absent/angry parents, hours and hours of extra planning and grading etc.  I'm 100% teaching.  All I do is work with the kids all day.  I may not have room for career growth but every day I feel like I make a difference for my students more than I ever did as a teacher.
	comment 40: It makes me so sad to hear this because I know exactly how you feel.  I stuck with it somehow for 12 years mainly because I had to.  I had no other skills.  But I literally got sick.  It is so disheartening because nursing school takes a long time to complete.  Pre requisites, then BSN.  All the sacrifice and effort.  Then you start working and the toxic soul sucking shit starts and never ends.  💯misery.
I am glad you have another way of earning money.  Be happy in your life!  But I hear you loud and clear and am so sorry you are going through this.  Best wishes to you!!
	comment 41: Watch John Oliver on dialysis companies. https://youtu.be/yw_nqzVfxFQ?si=YavtOT7UQJqnkzbS
	comment 42: I worked in a few dialysis units as a social worker when I was fresh out of graduate school. There was night and day difference between my favorite (the first one I worked at) and the last one I worked at (horrible management, practically no connection with my co-workers, witnessed tech screaming at our manager one day and she was still allowed to work there, etc.) The one you are at now sounds toxic. I'm sorry. I went back to school to be an RN as a second career and I don't regret it. Was a floor nurse in a busy hospital for 5 yrs and now I work in Occupational health, which for me is better for work/life balance and don't have to work weekends or holidays. Know that it's not you. At the shitty last dialysis unit I worked at, all of the good people would leave after a few months, every single time. Totally understand if you want to change your goals after your current experience. Dialysis is ROUGH. You see lovely people die in front of you all the time, that's not going to change. PACU, Rehab (like a rehab unit for ppl recovering from strokes), Endoscopy, Circulation nurses (OR), those nurses seem more content and less frazzled.
	 comment 43: Agree. My mother is a longtime RN and she hates floor nursing. She has said her happiest times were when she was a PACU nurse, and now she works in a day surgery center (mostly injections/arthrograms/hand surgeries) and she loves it.
	comment 44: I’m a nurse and I have a found a specialty that doesn’t make me want to die, but damn my first year I was actively wanting to die so I could not have to go to my job. It was awful. Hindsight being what it is I would have gone into a different field. Nursing sucks. Healthcare sucks. It is not getting better. If coffee makes you happy and you can make a living do it.

	 comment 46: I’m in LA but I’d love some recs for when I come visit my brother!
	comment 47: This is so discouraging to read because we are all someday going to need serious healthcare, but the harsh work conditions in the system are forcing out good people like you who really care. I don't know if the people are so shitty everywhere... if it's really your dream you could try another city/location maybe? But that's a lot to put on the table at the risk of it being just as shitty there too, combined with less of a local support system of friends for you. It was just a thought. Thank you so much for putting your best foot forward, OP. You've tried it now, and it sounds awful. I couldn't do it. I don't blame you for a minute to wanting to get back to being a barista.
	comment 48: I'm sorry you're having a tough time.  I wonder if maybe you should take another chance with a different employer or two though?

If it still goes bad, then you won't be alone.  The health care industry, specifically nursing, has a bad reputation of bullying.

Also, within the past year, a health care women committed suicide and wrote an open letter too her abuser, which she named as the for-profit health care system.  You can find the letter via google; it's heartbreaking that she started off wanting to help people and got worn down to the point she no longer saw hope.
	comment 49: Try not to be too quick to judge nursing just yet. If you worked for the giant dialysis company that's out there, then it makes sense. 

My wife worked many years in onco, infusion, med-surg, etc.  She works as an IV nurse now that gives IV vitamin infusions to people that actually want to be there. No insurance companies involved or anything like that. Totally different way to use the degree properly and be out of the train wreck that is Healthcare.
	comment 50: Nursing is an extremely challenging job. Learning continues endlessly after grad. Night shifts can be brutal. Missing holidays is tough. It can be emotionally draining/physically exhausting. The pressure can be suffocating. It can, however, also be a beautiful career. 

Sometimes you have to try a unit, and hate it, in order to realize that's not where you belong. But when you do find a specialty where you belong, it can be such a fulfilling and rewarding career.

There's a little voice inside your gut. Listen to that voice because it's rarely wrong. Don't silence your gut instincts because of unsupportive staff and a negative clinical experience. If I had done that, I would have been filled with regret. If that little voice is still telling you to go to nursing school, I think you are meant to go. 

If you think you could be truly happy long-term as a barista, and that's where your heart is, then be a barista. Life is short, it is precious and we only get one shot at it. Don't let other people silence your dreams. Empower that little voice in your gut! Best of luck to you!
	comment 51: 8 years in healthcare here: I get it. May you find the peace you deserve.
	comment 52: Copy this and put it in your 2 week notice. Name names.
	comment 53: If you are able to start your own coffee shop do that instead, youll be much happier and wealthier in 10 years than you would a healthcare tech, all these clinics are getting bought up by venture capitalists and hedge funds if they arent already and just eviscerating pay and quality of care, its only going to get worse.


Its also never been easier for people to start and operate their own coffee brand, so once you get your coffee sgop set up you could easily make your own brand. Its so easy these days to communicate directly with various coffee farms and buy directly from them then just package the coffee on your own.

Politics aside, black rifle coffee found a niche making their coffee brand and recently went public and made a bunch of money for themselves on their IPO, their politics suck but its just an example.

There are plenty of youtube videos of people starting their own coffee brands
	comment 54: I’m in healthcare and some settings are just the literal worst. Private equity and corporations are ruining healthcare. But there are a lot of companies/settings that are much better than that. So I wouldn’t give up entirely, maybe take a break, but keep looking for a better, manageable setting.
	comment 55: Is there a reason you were attracted to dialysis? I’ve been a nurse for 6 years and you couldn’t pay me enough to ever work in a dialysis clinic as they have horrible reputations. If you are passionate about nursing I think you’d like oncology way more than dialysis!
	comment 56: My mother is a nurse, my aunt, my cousin, basically most people in my family are in healthcare . They always say the worse part is the fellow nurses. Apparently they are straight up toxic now. I tend to think toxicity starts at the top & a lot of these places are cutting staff & showing them they have no respect for anything over profits. So I’m not surprised it’s trickling down.
	comment 57: If you swap back to coffee, you have so many ample transferrable skills now from this dialysis journey that you could probably step in to be a general manager of a shop if you haven’t already. Also check out bartending! Lots of overlap in coffee and patient center fields in terms of skills and can be serious money.

It didn’t last long because of moving abruptly, but I once worked at a French brunch spot doing their espresso drinks and “bartending” at once aka making lots of mimosas. It was such good money and so comfy. Might be worth looking into if there’s a similar set up near you! 

My vote is you do what makes you happy, especially if the pay is about the same without obvious pay ceiling growth on the table.
	comment 58: As someone who’s been in the service industry for years, I would definitely be cautious making it a lifetime career. In my experience, it’s a fine job until it isn’t, and then it’s REALLY bad. Having a backup would be a wise move. 

That being said, if you’re happy being a barista. By all means be a barista. There is no one set path to life.
	comment 59: They hate you because they know you are talented and won’t be there long. The manager loves you because he’s going to drain the ever loving fuck out of you. 

Get into another field within healthcare. Yesterday. Don’t tell nobody.
	comment 60: Get the cert and stay current. Be a private home nursing operator. Health care is falling apart, the only people who stay in it will be running their own small business - nursing will still be needed, and people with money will not want it happening in the shitscapes that hospitals have become / are becoming.
	comment 61: There's no guarantee every working environment in your field will be like this!! I've been in these toxic environments before and moved to do the same job elsewhere and realised, its not the job. 9 times out of 10 its the people. Definitely get AWAY from there!!!

I left and didn’t regret it
	comment 65: I had a terrible job in healthcare (worked as an ER tech) for a year and hated it and can relate to a lot of what you wrote. The anxiety I felt as I pulled up to the hospital was overwhelming. I thought it meant working in healthcare was not for me, so I left the field completely and did something completely different. I got the itch to try it again and recently got back to healthcare. I work in a completely different setting now (on an ambulance) and I love it.

It sounds like your workplace is terrible and you have terrible coworkers. I would consider trying a different job first before you leave it for good. You could try and use this bad experience you had to look out for red flags in new positions. I regret not doing the same and wasting those few years I took a break.
	comment 66: Dialysis is a horrible assembly line. The patuents are miserable, the worker are paid a pittance, only the owners make money. Have you considered a healthcare job somewhere else? My niece loves being a cardiac nurse. One of my favorite folks is my mammogram technician. My Dad was was on hospice off and on for 4 years, and many of the lovely hospice workers are now friends. By all means change jobs, but maybe dont give up of healthcare til you try another niche that might be a better fit.
	comment 67: God, I am sorry you went through that. It absolutely sucks.

I used to work healthcare as well (both in walk-in care and mental health care, hospital and residential) for most of a decade. It was absolutely horrible and until the US strains out of healthcare system I will absolutely recommend anyone looking to get into healthcare runs as far as they can in the other direction.

Constant double and triple shifts. Constantly being cut off by my supervisors and not given the supplies I needed to do my job. I was frequently assaulted, sexually assaulted twice, sexually harassed by coworkers and got told "well maybe you should think about why they said that". And none of that includes the typical stuff you would expect working healthcare/mental health care (I had a coworker decide that "COVID was a myth,and I want the days off", so they deliberately exposed themselves and then came to work before testing positive. My daughter had severe health issues at the time). 

I left to basically become what is essentially a call center worker, and god, it has been night and day. 

Healthcare, in my experience, is designed to do the same thing retail is: crush souls and drive turnover, so that employee costs can be kept down. it's why the push for PAs and NPs over doctors whenever possible, and why CNAs, MHTs, MOAs, and other "less trained" jobs are being used more and more.

That's the end of my rant. I hope barista work suits you better, and best of luck in your endeavors. You got this!
	comment 68: My husband and I were told that there is a critical shortage of Anesthesiologists in the greater Portland OR area. Elective surgeries are pushed out 6 to 8 weeks.

	comment 70: I spent 7 years of my life pursuing a doctorate in physical therapy. My passion my entire life has been to work in healthcare. Almost 3 years after graduating and trying a variety of different settings I quit PT in favor of tech. I spent so much of my life becoming a PT it was a really hard decision but the quality of life for people in healthcare is garbage.
	 comment 71: I have a DPT also. Someone from my cohort did the exact same thing you did. He tried patient care for a couple years and now works in tech and feels it better suits his personality. The push for productivity and low pay/respect for a doctorate level clinician were what did it for him I think.

They are awful and have a toxic and low-paying culture, so how you were treated is not surprising and does not represent all of healthcare.  Hospital dialysis RN's make a lot of money... There are many non-bedside jobs you could do if you decide to go for your RN, from clinical research to writing, to clinical informatics that will pay well.  Just something to consider.
	comment 73: Sorry to hear. But maybe stay in the health field scope. I work EVS (housekeeping) no drama get to be around patients still and interact with them. It seems to some to be a sucky job but I truly like it. Union, pension and I make $26 an hr. Evenings and weekends are $28 an hour. And they are only 8 hour shifts.

what a shitty experience you’ve been through for something you’ve worked damn hard to get.   


Good luck in your endeavours.
	comment 75: Oh I’m so sorry that this has been such a terrible experience. 

I think having a patient die might be the absolute worst experience anyone could have at work and you likely need some compassion for just how difficult that is. I am so so sorry for your loss. 

I know, for me, I never make big decisions when I’m feeling this low - if I absolutely HAVE to do something to make myself feel better, I cut my hair. It’s often enough to help me feel like I’ve taken some decisive action and I can then regroup and figure out what I want to do. 

Sending you so much love and hope for dealing with this.

	comment 77: Big hugs. You definitely dodged a bullet. I'm so sorry to hear about your awful experience, but not surprised unfortunately. Health care is brutal and can be awful. At times, health care can have a very cliquey environment. 

The silver lining is that you didn't spend more time investing into nursing school and that you have a great barista career to go back to.

I hope you go back to your barista job with excitement and zeal. Think of this as a 3-4 month detour where you learned what a nightmare health care can sometimes be.   Best of luck!  Very excited for you to go back to being a barista and working on your art and your next adventure!
	comment 78: Ugh. I’m nannying my way into nursing school, and I am already so anxious for so many reasons. Only reason I’m sticking with it is because you can leave the country with nursing.
	comment 79: I'm so sorry it's been so awful! I spend two and a half years on midwifery school in Europe, and even tho it wasn't as bad as what you described i still got (close to/what seems like) burnout at 20 years old. My fellow students were amazing and only some of the hospital staff were awful to us directly, but the schedules and workload and stress and pressure they put on us, while themselves being so overworked, and the sub par care we had to give patients because of all that, just killed me. I tried so hard to pull through, telling myself it will get better if i just study and practice and work more. All it did was grind me to the bone, past and potential work situations never left my head, i dreamed of awful work scenarios every night. Towards the end i wasn't a person anymore, i didn't eat, i didn't take care of my place, i didn't have a social life outside of my bf, who is the reason i managed to pull myself out of that at the last minute, where i almost cried whenever i had to leave for my shifts. Because up until the very end i loved the work still, i loved my patients, i loved caring for them, i loved the medicine, and i couldn't admit to myself that it was tearing me apart. Two years later I'm still struggling with depression that started during that time. So i just want to say, be honest with yourself, be careful about warning signs, take care of yourself first, and get out if it's what's best for you. At the very least look for a different workplace! Those conditions are horrible, and there has to be a better place somewhere, where you can still do what you love without hurting yourself.
	comment 80: So sorry you have been unhappy with this.   It sounds like you have been treated awful. 

Something I really regretted when I had a job go bad was not looking around more.  See what other bosses there are within your organization,  or what other companies are hiring. 

I know this sucks now, and I’m not saying this has to be your life— but take a minute to review your current and future opportunities.

Is this a job that could be long term better paid, benefits?   

I am more of a dig in and stick within forever mentally,  and that isn’t good either.  But learning to shift is a useful skill.
	comment 81: Yeah sounds about right. If you want your soul crushed and crippling anxiety go into healthcare. 

I work for a place that failed their accreditation and we had to put plans in place for corrective action to fix things. As soon as the accrediting body left our managers told us to immediately go back to how we were doing things before. It's dangerous and it's the norm in healthcare.
	comment 82: Do whatever is better for your mental health, you're all you have, take care of yourself, before taking care of someone else. Maybe you just need time to regroup and make other decisions. Whatever your future would be is your decision to make.
	comment 83: Sorry to hear this. Our world only keeps spinning thanks to good-hearted people like you. Your work in any field shines as it is clear you care about people. Not to make excuses for your healthcare coworkers, however; everyone is beyond tired - they are the walking wounded. Compassion fatigued, burnt out, etc. Not a good place to be right now. 

I would not blame you for going back to being a barista. You can be nurturing and caring to people with that work. Make sure you take good care of yourself and build your circle.

	comment 88: Male medical technologist here. 8 years in healthcare here and finally decided that I need a change literally last week. The combination of commodifying health, the amount of "I'm the smartest person in the room" types the field attracts, the monotony of laboratory work, the increasing hostility and skepticism with which the healthcare system is greeted by patients... It's just too much. Whatever love or interest or passion I had for healthcare has been snuffed out altogether.

Sorry to hear you had such a shitty experience. Dialysis companies are pretty notorious for being awful. Good luck in whichever direction you choose!
	comment 89: I'm sorry!

I'd document all the breaks and other bullshit and bring that up even if it's as you leave. Sadly, your "mean girl" experience in healthcare is one I've heard often.

	comment 94: As someone who works in healthcare, if you have another job that you know makes you happy, has lifestyle perks, and pays decently, then I suggest staying there. 

Healthcare has many positives, but also tons of drawbacks - it’s often toxic as a work environment, you’re undervalued by management and often patients, it requires education which is expensive and stressful, the hours often suck, I could go on …

I think owning a coffee shop sounds like a lovely life.

i’m grateful for the good work you did at the dialysis center.  i have a loved one who has to go 3 times a week & i know they would love to interact with a kind person like you.

	comment 99: I'm so sorry that this had been tough on you. Sometimes reaching for that brass ring ends up not being worth it. I've been working in a medical laboratory for three years. The work is kind of gross and smelly sometimes, but my immediate coworkers are so sweet and kind and supportive. I don't make a ton of money but my work-life balance is good and I have the energy to read, go to the gym, bake cookies and cakes for my friends, and every week I cook dinner and play games with my mom and dad. I keep thinking that I should go into speech pathology (I have a bachelor's degree in linguistics) and my friends keep trying to interest me in higher positions in laboratory medicine, MRI tech, or ultrasound tech, but I don't know if the increased stress and the high cost of more education would be worth a bigger paycheck, even it it's in my field. I am also planning on doing some important things with my healthcare and it would be less stressful to rest and recover knowing that I am coming back to my same old job that hasn't changed much rather than a brand new one. 

I like how you mentioned the enjoyment you get from talking with people and being part of a community. I love helping people, but I've had a lot of bad experiences that keep souring my dream of working with the public more directly. I get more out of seeing the same people regularly and building relationships with them than always meeting new people every day. 

I hope you're able to find more time to spend with your family and friends and cute puppy! Whatever you choose, I hope you're always able to be the person that makes you the healthiest and the happiest.

Even if your coworkers have been horrible to you, I just want to know that your time has mattered ❤️ I lost a grandparent to kidney failure and the amount of time I spent with them on dialysis was insane. It kept them alive so much longer and you have done that for your patients. You’ve given them time and helped them live. Your efforts were not in vain. Thank you for your job well done!
	comment 103: Hon. I get it.

I'm an old lady, now retired.  Used to be a law clerk. Tell everyone to stay the hell out of the legal arena.

But I beg you to finish your qualifications.  And then you have OPTIONS later.  It will give you choices, in years to come, that you might want.

Now ... Training is HARD. You're ultra stressed, on high alert all the time, nothing has been practiced for long, so you're THINKING every minute, worried to get it right ... And everyone around you is SUPPOSED to correct you so you'll learn the right way. And that feels like being under a microscope and being attacked constantly.

Been there, done it, have a few t-shirts.

Now ... hanging in there, and qualifying means an option to go looking for a less TOXIC workplace.  I guarantee that the same job done in two different places are different environments. 

And losing someone, to death, is as hard as hell when you KNOW that you will suffer this pain again because it's the job.  Personally, in law, a few close clients died, I was intimate with their lives, and it was shattering to lose them like that.  "Just a client" "Just a patient" doesn't apply when you got to know them on a very personal level.  It hurts when they die.  I wrecks you, and you just want to run away.

So.  See what you can do to brace up, and finish what you started. Then dust off your resume and see if you can't find a kinder place to work.

I send my very warmest hugs of support and encouragement, if you'll have them.
	comment 104: I'm so sorry. That really does sound like hell. 
What a hard choice. 

What kind of nursing did you plan to do once you're graduated? Maybe there's a field that isn't so mean?

Alternatively,  if you know this isn't going to work for you, that's ok too. There's nothing wrong with the batista life.
	comment 105: Get out of the dialysis center, oncology would def be a nice change I’m sure. Don’t give up this early.
	comment 106: >I made one mistake yesterday (forgot to set up 1 machine of the 12 I prepped before my lunch) and **two of the techs had a closed door meeting with my manager and made me a childlike “duties of your job” list**, implying I haven’t been doing my job well- instead of just saying something to my face.    

>**My manager keeps asking me “when are you taking your final exam?” and telling me how excited he is for me to finish my training**       

I'm assuming your coworkers made that list? Ask for a closed-door meeting of your own with your manager, explain the situation, ask the manager if they're satisfied with your performance and ask them if they have any idea why your two coworkers felt the need to make that list, since they're your coworkers, and not your manager.    

Since you've invested so much time and money into this profession, maybe start looking for other places of employment and bounce once you complete your training.
	comment 107: The truth is, healthcare can be very rough especially for people on the lower end of the latter - who get the grueling practice AND shitty pay. 

I will say, many of the things you mention will be significantly better if you do go through with it and become a nurse. Find a good position with a strong union (not difficult for a nurse, many nurses are unionized) and you will be guaranteed an 8 hour shift. If you are oncology specialized $100k+ a year is more or less guaranteed. The work is still hard and there’s a lot of responsability, but being a nurse is much more of a regular upper middle class job than a tech, which many places treat like a disposable resource
	comment 108: Yeah, nursing is not a glamorous job tv portray. I have been a night shift nurse for 2 years and it's not easy, I feel like I only survived because of all the kind and supportive colleagues around me.

But I would say work experience varies a lot by location. For example, I work in a hospital located at the better part of the area, and things are calmer, people are nicer. In the poorer part of the area, hospital are crowded with people with substance abuse, and the nurses are overworked and not happy about their experience.

When I was a CNA I had a patient who died because she voluntarily stopped dialysis. Before she stopped the dialysis, she asked me what's the meaning of life and I had no answer. I was completely oblivious and only found out she passed away after I got back from my 3 day break, that's when I realized she was just done with all of it. So it's true that they see it coming, they (should) know the consequences and it might be what they wanted...
As for the people making jokes about it, I would just like to think it's their coping mechanism. It's a tough job and they see a lot of things... I hope the passing of your patient don't make you feel too sad...

It sounded like you share emotion of people around you, then majority of nursing might not be the best fit for you. There are some happy stories of making recovery, but those are less common. It's overall pretty depressing. 

Of course, there are many other type of nursing that's less depressing like wound care, physical therapy, behind the scene or even work for the government on facility regulation etc. So try looking into it first.

But if nursing is making you depressed, don't force yourself. Do what makes you happy!
	comment 109: I’ve been in coffee for 8 years now and have worked my way up to a GM role at a mom and pop store. I make $22/hour plus get bonuses (up to $350 a month when all metrics are hit) and still get hourly tips ($5-$10/hour in cash daily). I’ll pull in around $60k this year. That’s at a GM wage. My baristas make $15 an hour (plus the cash tips) and only ever work 20 hours a week or so. If I were you, I’d personally try to find a different job in healthcare (travel nursing I’ve heard is lucrative) before leaving completely and going back to coffee. It’s a 50/50 every day if the customers are going to be amazing or awful, it’s physically demanding and taxing on the body, and just as mentally demanding and taxing.

I work in hospital credentialing and lasted about a year in a medical staff office located inside a hospital. I don’t think people realize how hospitals are until you’re actually working in one. It’s madness. I don’t know how people do it. Now I work in a central verification office (and work from home). I’ll never go back.
	comment 114: I was going to school to be a vet tech. 
Found a job at a local vet clinic as an assistant in the meantime. 
First clinic was TOXIC. Horrendously so. Young assistants all watching TikTok and talking about their sex lives and drinking. I’m a quiet demi-sexual stoner so I didn’t really fit in with their clique. They would go to the head tech and just spew crazy lies, like that I had “rolled my eyes” at one of the other VA’s because she told me I needed to wait to check the fecal samples. I don’t roll my eyes, it can make me feel faint and illicit a vertigo response. (Also I’m THIRTY?? I’m not rolling my eyes like a teenager??) 
They were so mean and nasty to me, allowed another vet tech to tell my ex husband my WORK SCHEDULE and didn’t think it was a safety risk. When I walked out, they head tech says “well the fact you don’t think we can keep you safe says more about you than us!”

What??

And the second clinic literally fired me for being too stupid to work there and they didn’t like me asking questions to ensure I was doing the job right. 

I clean houses now.

I witnessed how busy and how rough the job can be, the day I pick3d up my family member to take them to the ER. That same moment they had a patient being transported to the ER via ambulance. I was grateful my family member was not as critical.  

I have a direct blood related family member who is an RN and works for a dyalisis center as well. I've been told how many ways a patient can pass away during dyalisis.  So, the same treatment that is keeping you alive, can kill you. 

Healthcare is a rough industry. It's not the rossy picture the TV shows have to entertain people.  The smells, sounds, emotional and physical toll are astounding. 

I hope you find a part of Healthcare that can be manageable with your expectations (work life balance, mental health, ect).

So I politely decline.  And all the managers and some colleagues act like there's something wrong with me.  I keep getting, "But we think you're ready for it," as if it's a confidence issue.

Only the doctors and upper management get paid well in American healthcare. PAs and APNs do well too (~150k after several years of work as a nurse/some healthcare experience + schooling). Respiratory therapists and various techs and RNs have it rough. I wouldn’t do it if I could make similar money running a coffeeshop. There’s a reason so many nurses here are Filipina/o.
	comment 129: RN for 41 years. There really is no good nursing job. If you like your barista work and have other dreams follow them. Nursing can be soul sucking. All of your coworkers are just as stressed as you are and that makes it hard to enjoy your work. Add to that the never ending threat that one mistake can end your career for good.  On the positive side you will never have to worry about being unemployed, you can work anywhere and any shift, the pay and benefits are good, you literally save lives and that is as rewarding as it gets. Helping people at their most vulnerable and easing suffering will fill you with such gratitude. You can work as little or as much as you like.
	comment 130: Nursing school drop out here-- I wish I had never done it, even though it was my dream job. It's extremely stressful and nurses eat their young.

	comment 131: I worked for 10 years as a Respiratory Therapist. I got laid off at the beginning of all the 2020 pandemic shut downs because I specialized in PAP therapy and sleep medicine. Once the sleep labs closed my job went away. I had no desire to jump back into the hospital during a pandemic. I took the time to reassess what type of work I wanted to do. I was completely burnt out on the poor work/life balance of healthcare. Since I had a strong scientific background I was able to secure a job as a lab tech in a microbiology lab. I found that I really like lab work. The pay is good enough that I always have money leftover at the end of the month for my savings. I only work 40 hours a week. No on call or overtime. Don't stay stuck in something that makes you miserable. I recommend you speak to someone in the alumni association at your current school who is working in a field you might be interested in. I've found my school's alumni association extremely helpful.
	comment 132: It’s absolutely terrifying to me that the people responsible for literal life or death decisions are treated so horribly and forced to work in such inhumane conditions. It’s like the healthcare industry *wants* their employees to be so exhausted that they end up giving subpar care.
	comment 133: Look, I will tell you that I worked full-time while going back to nursing school, thinking I'd found my calling. Nursing turned out to be terrible (for me at least).  I felt as though my soul was taken out by that job and crushed to dust. After about 6 years I managed to land a job I don't hate, but it's barely even nursing really.

Although with my current job I'm no longer insanely unhappy, I don't feel like the same person I was before nursing. I turned into an empty cynical shell. I would never go back to working on the floor again. I think I would seriously jump off a bridge first. The only reason I stuck it out was because I'd spent so much time and money going back to school for nursing, that I couldn't fathom spending more time and money to switch careers again. Since the day I started nursing I looked for a way out of it.
	comment 134: I know someone who spent years going to school for respiratory therapist. She quit after like 6 months because the toxic work environment and being asked to do things out of her scope if training, along with some ethical violations she was asked to ignore. She became a teachers aide and eventually a high school teacher. When someone takes a pay cut and finds the politicians of a high school teacher less stressful than medicine, medicine has a problem.

It wasn't even that much more money. Now I've just got a job as a christmas temp in a shop and whilst it's not ideal, at least I won't hate it as much. I'm going to keep my eyes open and try to work for the company I was with before as I loved working for them.

It sounds like the people working there are used to seeing people burn out within the first year, and they don't like how hard you work because they don't want to work that hard.

	comment 142: Definitely quit and make sure if you have any PTO to use it first. Then remember that this org’s culture is not indicative of the overall culture in healthcare. It’s different from room to room, department to department, hospital to hospital, and state to state. 

You put direct patient care on your resume so it served it’s purpose. Now finish your degree, mourn the hurt of that place, and then regroup. Give yourself grace and process this experience, then let that smart, bold, brave, hardworking lady in you make a decision. 

I have a similar story and I think I understand what you experienced but of course I’ll never know for sure. But I can say, your ability to assess this jobs failures and to feel that hurt is a strength. Let it lead you to the next step even if that’s temporarily at that fun coffee spot.

	comment 143: Hey. From someone who’s been in medicine for 15 years and also leaving the field — you’re right. It’s an understaffed underpaid unappreciated place to be and it’s only getting worse with time. Do what makes you happy and don’t look back.
	comment 144: I am sorry you had that experience,  having been in healthcare for 15 years, I dont think there is any amount of money you could pay me to work in a Dialysis center.  Everyone I have been in is soul sucking.  You seem like someone who enjoys taking care of and helping others.  It is going to sound weird, but look into ems(not with AMR or other for Profit agencies, try to find a county or city owned one).  We get to go out in the community to help people ever day, every day is different.  The hours are 12 usually but that mean you work around 15 days a month.  There are some downsides, but being able to help people does a lot for countering them.  I know how much toxic environments can just drain you.  I hope you find a path that makes you happy.
	comment 145: I’m so sorry for what you’ve been going through, OP. Let alone the insane work hours and unrealistic expectations, it’s unfortunate that you have to deal with such miserable coworkers in such a toxic environment. 

My girlfriend is a tech aide in Radiology and this post honestly could’ve been written by her. Her coworkers are so goddamn miserable. They’re always looking for reasons to get her in trouble, always giving her the quiet treatment, always being passive aggressive and causing drama instead of simply minding their damn business and doing their jobs. 

I don’t know what it is, but it seems a lot of miserable people work in the medical field. Good on you for doing what’s best for your happiness.
	comment 146: There are jobs in healthcare that pay better than nursing and are not as hard, and have normal 8-9 hour office type shifts 

Think about what MEN who get into healthcare do. Like, radiology / MRI tech or something. If you look around at the workers and it's mostly men they'll probably make more and be treated better

	comment 148: Life is too long to work with, or for, arseholes.

I did 25 years in IT roles.  When I started my working life, the way you stood out and progressed was to do your best.  If you noticed something wasnt working or had been missed, you made the person that was responsible aware, then you all banded together to make it right.

Something in the UK changed at the beginning of the nineties.  All the big companies re-wrote their hand books in such a way that each term could interpreted in what ever way suited the company best and things changed really quickly

A toxic working atmosphere soon followed where everyone was looking out for themselves and soon enough the way to stand out was to undermine others or point out their mistakes.

I left that life ten years ago and moved in to what most would consider a mundane and menial job.

Im happier and my mental health has improved massively.  Something that my children noticed within a few months.

You will never lose the knowledge you gained from your education, dont look back.

Im so very glad you got to this point way ahead of when I did.

	comment 150: Hey there. Don’t let one type of nursing form your entire opinion of nursing as a whole. I have been a nurse for 12years and have worked in multiple different settings. By far the best schedule I found to be in Day Surgery. I have worked MedSurg, been a float Nurse, some IMC, Preop, and now I work in PACU. My first job was rough. Constantly running for 12hrs. But I found that that unit was not “nursing as a whole”. So many other options out there. Don’t let one bad experience ruin it for you. Try to get into a Graduate Nurse training program. You’ll get a lot more support that way.
	comment 151: Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry this is what you experienced! As other people have mentioned, health care is such a critical field and even more health care professionals will be needed in the future as the population ages. But the for-profit structure of the U.S. health care system makes it seem so broken. Like why would anyone subject themselves to the pay and hours and lack of workplace support when they could make the same salary with fewer responsibilities? Best of luck moving forward! It sounds like being a barista is a solid thing to fall back on. And it sounds like others here are offering useful suggestions for what you might do next. I hope you're able to find something you truly love that you can commit to!
	comment 152: I understand why you'd want to leave after that. I had a similar experience trying out health care work. I was a receptionist at a large clinic for about 2 years and I saw enough of the admin and hospital side to change my mind. Similar experiences with toxic co workers and managers. And watching the system suck money out of sick people (USA)  was particularly painful. I have assumed that some smaller, fewer and far between health care settings are better to work at. Some healthcare workers are better taken care of. 

I studied psychology in college but now I'm doing environmental conservation field work. It's much more satisfyingly. So I definitely support you changing your direction, too.
	comment 153: I won’t try to talk anyone into working in healthcare but I can say as a nurse that I decided not to go into dialysis after receiving a job offer with what sounded like pretty decent pay.
	comment 154: Dialysis is rough. Especially outpatient technician work. If you’re still thinking about nursing school- transfer to an acute program. You’ll work more independently and not around the toxicity that often comes with outpatient clinics. You’ll be exposed to so much more at work while going through school. 

You could also consider transferring clinics. I’m so sorry they’re treating you that way. I was a dialysis tech for 9 years before completing nursing school. I worked outpatient as a tech and also Acutes. I’m now back at outpatient as a charge nurse. If there’s anything I can do to help- please PM me.
	comment 155: It sounds awful. Your previous life sounds immeasurably better, do the brave thing and put yourself first.
	comment 156: I am sorry for what you are going through, and I am sorry for the patients that won't have you to take care of them.  It's a terrible loss when the good people are run out of their jobs by toxic coworkers and toxic work environments.  I don't know how or when we got like this.  I wish you the best whatever you decide to do.
	comment 157: Nursing is not worth it
	comment 158: I graduated from MLT school a few years ago and experienced a little of this. The only techs who would train me were travel techs at first. One woman decided she hated me because I did something wrong and I heard her complaining to someone else about it so I walked up and asked (very politely) what I did wrong and what I should do in the future. She never liked me after that. I joined the field in my 30s so I think it helps that I'm not young.

  
But women I've graduated with work at different clinics and hospitals and say they have cried every day because they work with such toxic people. I don't understand it at all. MLTs are so hard to find right now, why would you scare someone off? 

I work part time at a clinic right now but I actually love hospital hours. If I ever want to go full time again I'm going to do 3 12s at a hospital.
	comment 159: I used to work in the emergency room. There's so much about your post that I relate to. Nowadays, I do DoorDash, and I make the same money dashing as I did in the ER. Sending a massive hug and all the good energy your way.
	comment 160: I’m so sorry you had this experience. It feels like healthcare attracts the WORST kind of people.
	comment 161: Sorry about this experience.  Its not always like this and might be the company you work for. Would definitely try to shadow nurses in different specialties for better insight. 

I was a scribe in the ER trying to get letters of recommendation for medical school and was laid off after 6 months. Some of the doctors were Jerks. Made me not want to continue in that field.
	comment 162: Nope. You’re making a good choice.

I’m a nurse and I HATE this shit.

It’s legit a shitty career. Best advice i can give to anyone else: use it to make money, help some sick people along the way, then use the money to get out.
	comment 163: These injustices happen so often in woman dominated fields. I’m an educator and being pushed beyond your limits is common place. It’s a terrible system this country has especially for people who take care of our most vulnerable.
	comment 164: The medical field is brutal. I am an MLS and worked a trauma lab for 13 years. While there wasn't much toxicity in the lab, it was the fighting with nurses and doctors and the constant revolving door, made worse with Covid. I would train someone in the transfusion dept for 6 weeks and they would turn around and leave a few months layer, while I'm training the next tech for 6 weeks, as they also talk about leaving. It's exhausting. I resigned n Feb and I don't plan on going back. You need to do what makes you happy.
	comment 165: That sounds like hell. You have my full support.
	comment 166: I don't fuck with nurses anymore. Most are just rude as hell and think it's justifiable because their job is stressful. They have their cliques and tend to be super passive aggressive. I couldn't take it. They also literally hate their patients, even if they're one of the good ones.
	comment 167: DaVita?
	comment 168: I'm sorry to hear it. My wife was a dialysis patient, both hemo, and then peritoneal. While doing the hemo it was the people like you that would keep her sane being trapped in a clinic for hours every couple days. I completely understand the need to exit such a toxic environment. It's horrible that your coworkers have gotten so desensitized, and disillusioned.

For what it's worth, know that your patients value you more than you'll ever know, as do their families.

I lost my sweet Amanda November 24th of 2021, just shy of 23 years together, she was 42, she blessed me with two amazing children, and a life (albeit a short one) together that I'd not have traded for anything.

Of all the people involved in her medical care up to her passing it was her dialysis staff that I remember the most clearly. Always cheerful, always positive. Always just stellar human beings.

Sorry, if this is rambling... I get verbose when I feel her loss.

I say all that too day this, you need to do what's right for you. And whatever you decide just know that you've undoubtedly improved people's lives in ways you may never understand. And from one Internet stranger to another, for however long you've done it, or may continue to do so, I thank you for it.
	comment 169: Healthcare sucks around the globe. It's just like working in busy restaurants. Everything you thought you'd enjoy gets sucked out by these vile vampire pieces of shit, while they seem to cluster together and survive somehow.
	comment 170: That "childlike list" op, don't take it personally. It's a way to legally cover liability if you forget something. Otherwise you could claim you didn't know and it's the managers who would be on the hook.
	comment 171: You have experience now, you could try applying elsewhere and get more $?

If not, barista it up!
	comment 172: I hear you. But... Maybe try out another company before making a decision. The first year in every complicated job are very tough an difficult
	comment 173: Get out of the dialysis clinic and work at a non profit hospital
	comment 174: This is a general feature of our society: important work is structurally underpaid.

You have experienced going from privileged, frivolous work to doing important work. For this you have been burned.

Get out immediately. You will be branded as low class and barred from returning to your previous life if you allow anyone to develop a dependence on you. It starts with guilt; you are already experiencing this level. If you become important, you will be kept in your place by administration; your career will be stalled, and more surely the more competent you are.

These issues are structural. There is not a solution that doesn't involve breaking capitalism. Serve coffee and smile if you can; teach anyone you care about that they should strive to do the same. Real work uses people up.
	comment 175: Nobody thinks about the dental office but I worked thru the pandemic as a dental assistant.  All the PPE we had to wear was miserable…N95 mask, face shield, gowns that had to be changed with every patient,  it was miserable.  Then right before my boss retired, assholes in the neighborhood vandalized the heat pump for a little bit of copper wire thus we worked in 90 degree plus weather with all this miserable PPE on.
It was awful.  I hope the patients appreciated us and all we went thru just to get their teeth cleaned
	comment 176: try posting this in r/nursing for better advice
	comment 177: Leave that toxic place, take a breather, and reevaluate. There are nursing jobs that won't treat you like that - my dad just retired after 30+ years of nursing and I know he found it gratifying, and my best friend works in Healthcare and I know she's had terrible toxic jobs and wonderful ones, but also know that it's ok if your dreams and plans change! There's nothing wrong with enjoying barista work and i know my life is made better by the lovely lady that runs the coffee shop by my house. <3 You sound smart and hardworking, you're going to be amazing.

Post 4: Is it normal for men to enjoy getting you off?
	comment 1: Ah man. You sound like me when I met my fiance. I'm 29, about to turn 30, and we hit our 6 year anniversary in October. 

It should be normal. What's the point in having sex if your partner doesn't enjoy it? If they don't, or you don't care about their pleasure, you're not having sex. You're using another person to masturbate. 

I was suspicious of my fiance too. Partly for that reason and partly because I was abused extensively. (I remember early on, we were having sex and I don't remember what I did but I accidentally hurt him. I braced myself to get hit, and when it never came and he asked "why would I hit you?", I started crying. We immediately stopped so he could hold me, and he didn't just continue until he finished OR rush me to feel better so we could continue. Which ALSO made me cry MORE.) 

Sometimes there's good people. They're harder to find but they do exist.

Thank you so much like sharing this. I want desperately for more people to have moments like these in their lives, and it's brought me just about to tears to read about yours.

e: happy belated anniversary!
	 comment 3: [removed]
	comment 4: That is what the standard should be. When men don't care to get a woman off that should be a red flag, and means they are bad at sex.
	 comment 5: I second this. I don't really see a point in a sexual partner who doesn't satisfy you. Kinda like having a car that doesn't have an engine. If you have to push it anyway you may as well just walk by yourself.
	 comment 6: Yeah, I've found that a lot of men think it's fun that women can orgasm back-to-back so they enjoy beating their last high score lmao.
	 comment 7: Right here ^ . Getting my wife off gets me off.
	 comment 8: *gavel noise* Right? If not it means they’re bad at sex. Are there any male allies on this thread who will do a similar post but on a male centered or general subreddit we’d appreciate it. And our libidos will too 😓 I know it sounds awful but men tend to listen to other men who are sent as messengers on our behalf. Women are so used to this. It sucks.

If women only talk about thison female centered subreddits, the bois will never get the memo. What’s an appropriate male-centered subreddit for this topic? r/sex? r/askmen maybe. Then some Twitter star needs to do a #StopBadSex 🤣
	 comment 9: I literally panic when i dont get my so off. I enjoy the occasional quickie but like, seeing her get off is hotter than just me finishing
	 comment 10: [removed]
	 comment 11: Seconding this. 

Sex is a two player game. Even if we don't enjoy getting the partner off all the time, still should at least try or put in the effort.
	 comment 12: I am bad at sex but like getting my Wife off lol the fuck you mean?
	 comment 13: Seconded. This is not the standard but it should be. A good partner enjoys making sure their partner has fun too!
	 comment 14: It is isn't it?
	 comment 15: Is the red flag being bad at sex?
	 comment 16: No, it means they're selfish...total red flag
	comment 17: Man, it sucks that you even have to ask this! Don't be suspicious, enjoy! It's all too rare and worse in today's stupid climate!

If a guy doesn't wanna watch you squirm he probably isn't gonna be into you longer than a few weeks...
	 comment 18: Nothing gets me hornier than watching my wife cum.
	comment 19: I dated a guy like this once. Too bad he had flaws in other areas because it made just watching tv together very pleasant. 😂
	 comment 20: [removed]
	comment 21: Is it normal? Yes.

Is it common? Based on the comments on this subreddit, no.
	comment 22: Why is it so odd for your partner to want you to feel good? Shouldn’t it be the standard?
	 comment 23: emphasis on SHOULD. for women, it's rare. the orgasm gap is really really wide.
	 comment 24: Sadly it’s pretty rare
	 comment 25: It's rare unfortunately, communication and empathy really goes the distance. Emphasizing that you want them to have just as much fun when the conversation comes around really opens things up & I've found that if everyone's comfortable, especially women, both parties generally finish more/have more fun
	comment 26: A vast amount of my pleasure comes from my wife getting off. I do not understand selfish men who take no care for their partner's enjoyment. For me her enjoyment is 90% of my experience.
	 comment 27: ya theres something so fire about seeing her lose control to how u made her feel. its a lost art
	 comment 28: Same!! I swear I'm not finishing if she doesn't, it's like a requirement for me idk what the deal is but even hookups before I was married I MUST make them finish before I can, it's the twitching and shit that does it for me
	 comment 29: This man speaks the truth. Seeing my wife’s enjoyment is my favorite part 💯
	 comment 30: Me too - if I sense she's not enjoying it in any way or wants to switch things up, I pretty much start getting turned off. Being able to make a woman turned on is what makes me feel good - ill happily have sex sessions where I don't even come, making a woman come is the fun bit.
	 comment 31: You're all  doing the lord's work by preaching to others, sirs!

I'd call for a group hug.... but that might be too much. As a woman, I want y'all to know this gives me hope!
	 comment 32: Same… if all I cared about was my own pleasure I could just do it myself.
	 comment 33: Same man, if we have time I can easily spend 3-4 hours on my partner focusing on getting her off. Seeing her pleasure is what makes the whole experience so pleasurable for me as well.
	 comment 34: Absolutely. 
Even if she "wins" and I pop first, I'm still going to enjoy petting the bunny and getting her off after.
	 comment 35: Not selfish for the most part I think. Just unskilled?  Then again who am I fooling.
	comment 36: Yes it's normal, don't accept less than that. And reciprocate lovingly as well.

Make it normal for you.
	comment 37: I do. Sex should be fun and pleasurable for both people. Selfish lovers are lame. This is typically men because when they get off then it's usually, sex done. That's boring IMO
	 comment 38: Totally agree. Sex should be fun and enjoyable for all parties involved! I went from a dead bedroom marriage to someone with a much higher sex drive. What a difference it makes not only in how good the sex is, but how often I want to have it. 

My partner is all about making sure I come. I get off on him getting off and he gets off on me getting off.  It’s just this great cycle and it ends with orgasms for everybody and I wish more people could enjoy sex that way.
	comment 39: My man enjoys getting me off. He wants me to get off multiple times before I get him off. Last night he was going down on me and even though I had gotten off he made me get off 2 extra times and it was amazing and of course I reciprocated because it's such a turn on when they put you first. It really is. I call it sexual chivalry. It's amazing to have a partner do this for you.
	comment 40: Yes  it is pretty normal, and why wouldn't  it be, it's awesome to make your partner orgasm. There's no need  to worry, it's not sus, at least this isn't .
	comment 41: You hit the jackpot. This is how a man should treat his woman! Besides, it's incredibly sexy and a huge turn-on to see your partner pleasured and climax; clearly, he agrees. Enjoy.
	comment 42: For me it's normal. The last 10 guys (or so) I had sex with all enjoyed getting me off and sex was never only PIV.
	 comment 43: Agree.  I haven't had only PIV sex since I was a teenager.

If there's grown men out there doing only PIV as a rule, that's pretty sad.  Both partners are missing out on some great stuff.
	 comment 44: I feel like such an out of touch yt lady at 41... but what does PIV mean?🫣

Edit, 3rd times googling worked, nm
	 comment 45: it is the norm, I promise. I mean, sometimes we guys fail. how they deal with that probably varies. But anyway, at the very least, it's a huge ego boost to any normal man. And on top of that I dare say most men really actually do care about their partner's feeling and want to make them happy for their sake (even if it's just a one time hookup). 

But clearly their are also some men who actually don't care. dicks. not the norm. dump 'em.
	comment 46: I love getting my wife off.  It’s not as good of an experience if she doesn’t.  I’ve literally made it my mission to learn and study what it takes lol
	comment 47: I LOVE making my wife cum! Her moans drive me nuts, her face in ecstasy is absolutely beautiful plus knowing I brought her so much mind-scrambling pleasure makes me feel super powerful and manly.

Enjoy your relationship OP!
	comment 48: For me, it is probably the biggest turn on. But I don’t expect a woman to finish every time because I think that can create added pressure for her as well. But yes, seeing her go nuts with pleasure makes me go nuts.
	 comment 49: *gestures on behalf of the female council*

See here?! this one. They've unlocked the code! 

Seriously, thanks for getting the fact that for all humans, the brain tends to be the most pivotal sex organ.
	comment 50: Normal doesn't really mean much in the context of sex. I think a sex life where both enjoy getting each other off is the most enjoyable. Others might disagree, but if it is what you want then you should expect that from your partners.
	 comment 51: Why would anyone disagree? What would be the rationale?
	comment 52: For non selfish men who aren’t looking for hook ups yes. Too many men are selfish and actually hate women,
	 comment 53: Selfish/non-selfish is the wrong angle I think

Men who love to get a woman off get a big ego boost and plenty of endorphins.  It’s not entirely selfless, it’s just they are getting a different form of gratification, a very healthy mutually beneficial one
	 comment 54: I’ve had plenty of hook ups who make my pleasure the main course because it’s what *they’re* looking for. You just have to vet for it.
	comment 55: This is the best way. Partners who are in it because they enjoy getting you off are the best. (Sex wise)
	comment 56: This is how a man should be. I just love doing it to my man and he loves doing it to me. Sometimes we are just too tired for sex.
	comment 57: I'd say it *should* be normal. A lot of people are selfish assholes, however.
	comment 58: If it was normal there wouldn't be an orgasm gap. But it is a reasonable expectation for your partner to like getting you off
	comment 59: Uh, yeah. It’s absolutely normal for your sexual partner to be invested in your satisfaction. If not, find a better partner.
	comment 60: This is what should be normal. I was shocked to find a lot of women who engage in sex with cisgender men do not receive foreplay or even the opportunity to orgasm as these men either 1) have no idea how sexual pleasure works for women (ie "uhhhh what do you mean you need your clit rubbed or you can't cum wtf no other girl I've been with needed that" ((lmfao)) or 2) they just don't fucking care. 

I never had this issue with my husband. I feel for the all the women out there with these idiots. They really think their 5 inch dick is out there blowing minds and destroying pussies.
	comment 61: I love helping my fiancee get where she's going. I often enjoy it just as much or more than my own orgasm. It feels really good making her feel that good.
	 comment 62: My husband is the same, and if he gets a bit of an ego trip from the satisfaction of making me happy, he can have at it because it's well-earned! I get satisfaction from knowing he's enjoyed himself, too. 😊
	comment 63: Honestly I feel like anyone who doesn't enjoy their partner getting off has something wrong with them. 

It is by far the best part of sex for me and nothing is more exciting or gratifying to me.
	comment 64: In the immortal words of Lily Allen:

“Oh you’re supposed to care that you never make me scream”
	comment 65: Obligatory I'm a man disclaimer. I've heard a lot of men recount their sexual experiences and not seemed to care about this which has always confused me. In my personal experience the knowledge that my partner is experiencing pleasure is a HUGEE part of the experience. So while I'm not sure it's as common as it should be, it's definitely present and should be encouraged!
	comment 66: Enjoy it girl! My husband is like this and I consider myself very lucky. If I don’t get off twice he thinks he did a bad job. He was the first guy to ever get me off on our first time.
	comment 67: My partner LOVES seeing me get off. The rule when we STARTED dating was, I always have to finish first before your dick is getting anywhere near my vag; but we loosened up that rule after about a year of living together. Even if he goes first, he's happy to use the vibrator or his fingers on me for as long as I'll let him. Always tells me how cute I am, too!

Good dudes are just.. good dudes. And they're fucking RARE. Hang on to that one!
	comment 68: My husband is this way, so I think it’s normal!
	comment 69: Don’t be suspicious, it just means your previous partners were a little too selfish. Sex is supposed to be fun, and giving your partner pleasure is one of the most important elements. It sounds like you just have a guy who is sexually healthy.
	comment 70: I love getting my partner off. Makes me feel like I'm doing something right. It's also sexy as fuck.
	comment 71: I guess my attitude with my wife has always been...well... Im kindve a "sure thing". Im gonna have a good time pretty much as default. May as well focus on her having a good time since its almost impossible for me not to.
	comment 72: Marry him. He’s a keeper you lucky, lucky girl!
	comment 73: I once dated a guy and asked him what his favorite thing to do in bed was. He responded, “I like getting the woman off.” 

Yet, every time we had sex he either stopped as soon as he came or he’d go down on me for a few minutes and then give up. Became pretty obvious to me that he only said it because he thought it would make him sound good. 

(I discovered his favorite thing was getting his nipples played with. But apparently that was too embarrassing to admit 🙄)
	comment 74: It is normal for a relationship when you are not used as a sex toy.

It is normal to desire to pleasure your partner regardless of gender.

It is also sexy af to see your partner losing their self-control due to pleasure.

It is normal for the men worth dating.
	comment 75: It should be the norm but it’s unfortunately not.
	 comment 76: The bar is below hell.
	comment 77: I'm sorry you even have to ask this question. Some people like giving more than receiving, enjoy it. If I like the person quite a bit, making them squirm is often more fun than PIV imo.
	comment 78: If they aren't total sociopaths or sexists then yes, that's what empathy does, it gives you pleasure as you deal it.
	comment 79: Isnt this normal? Ive always enjoyed seeing my wife and past girlfiends like this afterwards, why should it stop feeling good for them.
	comment 80: It's hot to please
	comment 81: Hearing my wife enjoy herself is one of the hottest things in the world. Oral is probably a good 80/20 giving to receiving ratio in our relationship on the sole fact that I just love making her climax. I actually feel powerful in a weird sort of way. Especially because she's told me other guys haven't been able to get her off 😂
	comment 82: For me, this is the point of intimacy, but I believe I classify as a ‘pleasure dom’.
	comment 83: I love when my wife gets off. Literally is my favorite part of being intimate with her.
	comment 84: I find an aroused woman to be incredibly sexy. 

I get off when my wife gets off. I love watching her cum. It makes me cum. And holy shit do we cum hard.

	comment 89: Based on my experience (20 years of dating), I'd say it's common but unfortunately not "normal" (ie significantly less than 50% of men). Most men don't try very hard especially if it's casual
	 comment 90: If they don't try hard, they're gonna be left hard... know what I mean?
	comment 91: It is normal for men to claim that they enjoy getting you off, and then you actually go to bed with them and that number drops to about 10%. Sadly, although, almost all men claim that it’s important to them to get you off, the vast majority of them actually don’t give a fuck.
	comment 92: I like to wear my fiancee like ear muffs. Ladies never settle for a guy that wants to use you as a pocket pussy. As there's always a guy that'll treat you like an open buffet and he's a starved African.
	comment 93: It’s an amazing feeling to be able to make her feel good. That intimate situation, the warmth and scent of her in your arms. And seeing her enjoying it? Have her press against you, both trying to work together to get her off. That’s so amazing. So yeah love it.
	comment 94: Not at all, I think an important part of sex is wanting to give pleasure to the other person. Like others have said, the fact this alone is causing suspicion is a failure of your past partners and nothing else lmao.
	comment 95: My husband doesn't even penetrate me until he gets me off multiple times. It's the way it should be girl, now that you got it don't settle for less!
	comment 96: I (m) enjoy it. I want her to feel good, and simultaneously it's an ego boost for me because I was able to read her body well enough to get her to the finish line. It's extremely satisfying for me because it's a way for me to truly feel and understand her at a very primal level, and the big O Is confirmation that I understood her.
	comment 97: Is this not what all sexual partners do????? Genuine question from a lesbian.
	 comment 98: I’m sad to say that a lot of guys don’t care or don’t understand that most of us don’t get off just from vaginal intercourse.
	comment 99: Yes.
	comment 100: Men like this are a gift 🤌🏻🤌🏻
	comment 101: Yeah there's guys like this
	comment 102: I don't want to say it's uncommon, but I will say it SHOULD be common, and be an expectation you should bring to every relationship.

If a partner wants to get themselves off and doesn't care if you do, that's just masturbating with someone else's body. Not exactly a crime if it's a one night stand, but it's human decency to care that the sex feels good and is enjoyable to your partner. 

That being said, there are two kinds of people who enjoy getting their partner off: Considerate people who genuinely enjoy bringing joy and satisfaction to others for the sake of it (or simply that getting someone else off is literally a required part for them, mentally, to get themselves off) and people who ONLY enjoy getting others off because it stokes their ego. As in, "Damn, I was so good last night that she came three times! I'm super good at sex. 👍🏾" People can have both (I feel a twinge of pride when my boyfriend falls asleep just after sex - I know I tired him out and did an awesome job lmao), but men can also be so prideful that they just do it for the second reason, then you not finishing just becomes some sort of insult to their pride.

I've been fortunate enough to have only ever had two of the nine partners I've had in my lifetime not give a shit about my pleasure, but even of those seven that have, probably two of them fell unto the second category where getting me off a lot was to stoke their ego. I'd be tired, have finished twice, and they'd have finished themselves and wanted to be able to manually stimulate me to completion "just three more times babe", despite me saying I didn't even want to. That was for them, not for me, and that shit is annoying.

All in all, life is too short to not be ONLY willing to be physical with people who want to get you off as much as themselves, whatever the reason. Having that requirement really, really wouldn't dwindle your numbers of potential partners down lol. Lots of modern day men are more than willing to do that, without asking.
	comment 103: I enjoy getting my wife off. I love the reaction to me kissing her and going down on her. When we make love there has never been a time that I have not made her orgasm once if not multiple times. The way I see intimacy is that she is willing to make me feel good then I will do the same. Honestly, I get more turned on the turned on I can get her and the more orgasms I can make her have.
	comment 104: >so different from my past experience that I'm finding it hard not to be slightly suspicious

Suspicious? Of what?
	comment 105: I’d say this is normal, I think it should be the standard. My boyfriend is like this and it’s very lovely
	comment 106: Very normal and common in my experience.
	comment 107: I wish
	comment 108: I’m dating a guy who does it and at first it was very suspicious but now I really enjoy it! He says he loves to see me getting there and he’s really focused on giving me pleasure
	comment 109: the hot part is when your partner enjoys it
	comment 110: It’s weird how uncommon this seems to be. I’m fairly inexperienced compared to my wife and she had never had an orgasm until she was with me. Most guys get theirs and call it quits. Id feel bad if my wife didn’t get hers.
	comment 111: In my experience it’s normal for people who end up being good partners. It’s a green flag.
	comment 112: Imo the focus of sexual play, or sex in general, should be making your partner feel good, but yourself!

I honestly really enjoy making my partners get off, even if I don’t get to myself lol

Most people have sex to make themselves feel good, kinda a weird thing lol
	comment 113: This may be less common with younger men, but it's just normal sex. Both partners enjoy giving the other pleasure.
	comment 114: (guy here) nothing brings me more joy than getting my partner off. I think every partner should find joy in bringing their partner pleasure.

Kinda a red flag imo if they don't.
	comment 115: Yeah, it’s the shit.
	comment 116: It's the only thing that turns me on, pretty much. If there is a choice between giving head or receiving it - there's only ever one outcome I'll go for. I'm not that bothered about receiving a blow job whereas I want to go down on women every day, happily for 20 minutes straight, or more. My entire enjoyment centres on the woman being turned on and having orgasms. Plus, men only really get one shot whereas some women can chain orgasms, and some that can't can squirt multiple times in a short ish space of time, _that_ is the goal.

I don't know how common it is, but I guess it's not that uncommon.
	comment 117: It should be. Otherwise you get selfish or lazy lovers & that’s a deal breaker.
	comment 118: I literally cannot enjoy sex if my wife doesn’t have at least one orgasm. 

I am not the best sex machine in the world. I don’t get her there every time. I’m fairly garbage at penetrative sex, even without the goal of orgasm. So it’s usually fingers and tongue. But it’s gonna happen, or I’m just gonna go limp.

Edit: there’s an exception to this, if she’s trying to give me a treat and just get me off
	comment 119: This is me, I could totally make a whole evening out of it and be fully satisfied. Something about knowing you did a job well lol
	comment 120: I don't care if you have to low-jack him, marry him, etc.  He's a keeper!

I say this as someone who's in a land full of men with religious trauma that legit think touching my labia will put them in a front row seat in hell.

This is the goal, and I'm happy for the younger generation! Exploring sexuality can be fun! 

This has been a message from your hippy free loving reddit auntie 😄
	comment 121: Yes.
	comment 122: Former man, now trans woman here. I absolutely love getting my partner off! Especially women. Y’all make the best sounds
	comment 123: Well I have been in a relationship with the same woman since my late teens. I was never batting a  100%, but I was definitely up in the 90% for most of the relationship. Now at 40 years old I'm hitting 50%, maybe 55% and I get genuinely disappointed when I can't get the job done.

She says she has no problem she still enjoys our sexual interactions together and we still have sex more often then not, but I try to explain to her when she doesn't get there that it seems like failure to me. I say to her flip the script and imagine if I was only getting off 50% of the time you wouldn't feel a little inadequate?

Point is you should want a partner who, WANTS you to get where you need to be, so enjoy it and hopefully it lasts a long time for you and him. Best of luck
	comment 124: I like all the cute noises girls make when I am going to town on their boobs. In those positions, I'm getting a good look at their face, and feeling the full body squirm.
	comment 125: Most men don't like sex - they just want to get their rocks off and be done.

This guy likes sex.
	comment 126: That's called the bare minimum.
	comment 127: Yes it’s normal when it’s not shitty men
	comment 128: It may not be normal or common, but it is the minimum acceptable standard.
	comment 129: Sounds like hes not self centered like a lot a guys are.
	comment 130: I don’t enjoy it if she doesn’t get off.
	comment 131: Man or woman, don’t stay with a partner that doesn’t give a shit.
	comment 132: Yes. My goal is to actually get her off multiple times before I even start. Next question.
	comment 133: Can't talk for men, but as a gay woman hell yeah. I'm personally a butch top and am not so into receiving, so I really enjoy getting my partner off! I kinda don't care about my own physical body since that's just... not a thing for me? For some reason? But I find it very pleasing/pleasurable/whatever the right word is to get my partner off!
	comment 134: Good sex is making your partner happy. From a man who has been married for 16 years and still has great sex. This should be the norm!
	comment 135: If it isn't normal it should become normal.
	comment 136: It's normal at the beginning. It's not normal that they maintain it beyond 3 years. Enjoy and make no serious commitments to anyone. You have the whole world at your feet.
	comment 137: Yep. My fiance is exactly like this. If he's not at full salute, he'll get rock hard when I cum. He gets me off a minimum of 4 times. He'll go in for that 5th or 6th time after he came.
	comment 138: That's the only way to go.  If I'm not getting you off, I have no business asking you to get on.  Honestly, I often cannot get mine if she's not getting hers.
	comment 139: I’m a giver not a receiver at this point in my life lol I get busy as much enjoyment
	comment 140: Yes lol it’s normal.
	comment 141: So my favorite thing ever is to get my girl off. I like to get her off first. Then she gets me off, then I get her off again lol. Her cumming is the hottest thing ever to me.
	comment 142: I'd hope so. That's one of the only ways I can get a decent orgasm myself, if she isn't into it or having as much funn as I am then I'd rather just stop. Hah
	comment 143: I honestly don't understand how men, who have little to no interest in getting their girlfriend off, can keep getting sex with that girl. It really baffles me that women keep having sex with guys who are like "it's your job to make yourself cum". My reply would be "THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?!"
	comment 144: First time my current partner and I had sex, she told me it was the first time any guy cared to get her off. It wasn’t the first time a partner told me that

I just feel bad for women dawg
	comment 145: Green flag alert!
	comment 146: There are a bunch of men who grew up with the idea of selfish men having sex until they cum and then just go to sleep and got disgusted with the idea so they seek fufilment in making their partners cum.

Which sounds good until you hear stories of women faking orgasm because they don't want to deal with the man sulking like they're impotent.
	comment 147: Haven't you heard? Nice guys always come last. :D
	 comment 148: Beat me to it.
	comment 149: Very. Most decent men will want to, and really good men won't want to get off until you have.
	comment 150: Little late to the party. However, I want to underscore the difference between a partner who is interested in your pleasure and makes room for it, vs a partner who's self worth is tied to their sexual performance.

Knowing the difference saves on so much emotional labour.
	comment 151: How it SHOULD be. Don’t accept anything less. Sex should be 50/50 meaning both cum. Set your standards now or you’ll be faking orgasms for the rest of your life.
	comment 152: Yes some of us love it. I for one love the sight, the sounds and the knowledge, I (at least partly) made it possible also nice.
	comment 153: My stamina is terrible, nothing I've ever tried helps it either,  so I do everything I can to satisfy my lady and I really enjoy doing it. So I wouldn't say it's suspicious, be thankful you have an attentive giving partner.
	comment 154: Absolutely!
	comment 155: If I came and my wife hadn’t, I would feel awful. 

This is just the standard for “competent” men I guess? Crazy that the bar is so low you find this suspicious. Men have to do better, holy shit.
	 comment 156: Not me, we trade off sometimes.  We don't feel like everyone has to get off every time but we have equanimity overall.  Sometimes we just like to pleasure eachother but don't need immediate reciprocation. Sometimes, and get this weirdness, she can get off 2-3 different days without me even needing it, or vice versa, we'll get balanced eventually.  There is no desperation or bad feelings at all, everyone knows that they're getting satisfied over all.
	comment 157: I (m37) enjoy getting my partner off. I love her and her happiness is as important to me as mine is to her.
	comment 158: It absolutely should be. When my wife and I finish, and she got exactly what she wanted, it makes the whole moment.

Any guy who's 50/50 on getting you off is just using you.
	comment 159: All I can think is WHYYYY is this NOT the NORM?!?!!!!!
	comment 160: In a relationship yes, in hookups no.
	 comment 161: This is why during a hookup you don’t go anywhere near his penis until you come.

Get the orgasm up front.
	comment 162: It may not be as common as it ought to be, but taking pleasure in giving your partner pleasure *is* normal, and a very, very good thing. Sex is supposed to be a mutual activity that both partners enjoy, not something that one partner does to the other for their sole benefit.
	comment 163: It's normal. Even normal with a lot of low quality men because their egos get hurt if you don't get off, so I don't necessarily see it as an inherent green flag.
	 comment 164: Okay, but this just unlocked a core memory of a previous partner... 

Note: We're both pretty geeky.

he finished but I wasn't quite there... and after he realized when his mind cleared, he said "to the batmobile!" and started working his way around with his hands to tickle me and such.  I have a platform bed and he knew what bin I kept the "fun stuff" in and then said "to the bat cave! I need Robin's help!" Then proceeded to grab a vibrator... Dude was ON A MISSION. I damn near started to hyperventilate from laughing and enjoying myself.
	 comment 165: exactly! if he's observing your responses and truly into learning you-that's a green flag. if he's racing to give you 5 orgasms so his ego gets stroked (and it's uncomfortable pressure for you) that's a different story. but OP's guy sounds like the first type-congrats!
	comment 166: Absolutely!! The BEST part of having sex is making the girl you love cum.  The faces she makes, noises and the heavy breathing, biting of her lip, moving her hips, etc.  It is so very satisfying to know that you are giving her amazing pleasure.  It can be hard to hold back and wait for her, but it is so much better if I can wait and orgasm at the same time or just after she does.
	comment 167: If you want a guy's opinion as well, then yes the good ones do like seeing their partner get off and will do their best to ensure they do. I might even be on the weird side of it where I can fully enjoy sex even if I don't cum for whatever reason. If I can get the girl I'm with to have a good body shaking orgasm then I am happy and beaming with a little pride knowing that I can help get her there. I always try to give her more than one of those too.
	comment 168: I would have thought so, but from lurking here in 2X, I've unfortunately learned otherwise.

I (M48) can't get off unless I'm at least helping my wife get off. Oral (BJ), for me, isn't really enjoyable unless I'm at least giving her some finger attention. I may be extreme in that sense, but yeah, that's how big a deal it is for me.

Even out of pure selfishness, a guy should want to make sure you're fully enjoying it so that you'll want to do it more often.
	 comment 169: I’m similar in that I don’t usually come if he comes first. If he’s not lost in pleasure and lust while “servicing me” then it feels just like that - he’s at work and I’m up on the car lift. No thank you.
	comment 170: I thoroughly enjoy getting my partner off, turns me on even more. Just let him know you appreciate it!
	comment 171: For some men, it's a big fetish seeing woman enjoying themselves
	comment 172: Not at all, no. It's the unfortunate truth. That doesn't mean he has ulterior motives; he probably just cares about you having a good time or has a fetish for it.
	comment 173: Basically, it turns me on to turn you on.
	comment 174: If she gets off I’m going to be able to get off. If she ain’t into it neither am I. Just how I’m wired I guess.
	comment 175: That's the lowest bar. Don't sleep with men who don't enjoy getting you off.
	comment 176: He may be a pleasure dom😊
	 comment 177: Likely,  but he probably doesn't know it yet.
	comment 178: It's normal.

For some It's a kink. Depends how many times he tries to get you off at one time.
	comment 179: Yes it is. I just wished my wife would understand
	comment 180: Woman: my partner gets me off is somthing wrong???
lol the bar is so low.
	 comment 181: yes blame the women in this situation ! i see your critical thinking skills are very VERY good
	comment 182: I couldn't possibly say what's normal for other men, but I'm simply not having a good time if my SO isn't having an amazing time.
	comment 183: Dump whoever doesn't enjoy getting you off.    


I'm saying this as a guy.  


That being said, it doesn't have to be BOTH people getting off every single time. 'Cause both men an women can fall into post orgasm bliss stuper. But it should be like 50/50
	comment 184: Yes it is.   Some of us enjoy it, A lot.
	comment 185: Yeah it's normal for good guys, it should always be a priority.
	comment 186: it should be.
	comment 187: Next time theyre wearing you like a pair of sunglasses and youre not acting like your having a fit, theyre doing it wrong.


Had partners like this. I no longer accept partners like this. Its about both of us, not just them. Keep looking
	comment 188: Yes, we exist. I love pleasing my woman, and I even fantasize about it afterwards. I like treating her like "a king", and she seems to like it too.

It can be a problem if youre both submissive tho.
	comment 189: Oh this is me! Is this not normal???

 I literally can’t enjoy the activity unless the girl is enjoying it too. I’d be completely fine just getting her off.
	comment 190: It’s quite literally my favorite thing on earth to do. If my wife and I had sex tapes (and it’s not for my lack of trying lol), I would fast forward to that part.
	comment 191: Umm you should both enjoy giving pleasure to each other. Sex isn’t something men do to you. It’s a shared experience. Do not do anything that doesn’t give you pleasure or anything that makes you uncomfortable. He should get you off multiple times before he cums.
	comment 192: I’m a married man in my 30’s and I lurk hard on this sub because I’m always looking for ways to improve my relationship and communication style with my amazing wife. I absolutely love going down on her and making sure she has an orgasm when we make love because it’s  so much more enjoyable when she cums first. I take it with major pride when I get to walk around in public when I get to strut around with her juices all over my face.
	comment 193: tbh this is such a sad post lmfao. Like really youre suspicious??
	comment 194: Ha! Of course! Beyond any empathy, it can be really fun!
Like when you have plenty of stamina and a solid rhythm going and you know your partner can cum more than once so she does a sorta basic soft cumming that might not even be real but you keep that same rhythm because your not done yet and you build on it and she starts acting like she can't take it anymore but she doesn't say stop and instead starts tearing apart the skin on your back with her nails but you barely even feel it then she finally explodes and it's like watching a legit seizure then she kisses you 1000 times in a way that makes it seem like a muscle memory response and not something she could stop doing even if she tried...

I think most guys love that.
	comment 195: I think it's relatively normal. I personally enjoy getting my partner off, but I know plenty of women don't like it.
	comment 196: Some guys (rightfully) think it’s important to satisfy their partners. Some guys also get their own pleasure from it. And some are both. Humans are really sexually diverse in their desires, and this one just happens (presumably) align with your needs. I hope he’s also just a good partner in general as well!
	comment 197: Have fun.
	comment 198: It is sad that this is not the norm.

I enjoy getting my girlfriend of immensely and have done so with future partners as well.

Why wouldn't i ?
	comment 199: Give it a year
	comment 200: Duh?
	comment 201: For me [M], “pet girl, girl purrs, we both get nice doses of the happy neurotransmitters” is one of the best things ever.
	comment 202: I worked out the calculus this way:

Guys: 1-2

Girls:  Lots-Ohmyfuckinggod

Now which market segment would you suggest has more growth potential to maximize yield for the overall bedroom pleasure portfolio?
	comment 203: Fuck men.  Honestly.  Can we be honest here? I fucked a guy who didn’t tell me he was a FELON lawyer fresh out of prison until afterwards. He stalked me and told me I sucked at sex and didn’t  even know who i  was because in his mind I just fucked strangers all the time. It was absolutely horrible. I would have liked to know he was a felon beforehand but he not only didn’t tell me but then, after realizing I was disgusted with what he did to go to prison, hated on me told me I sucked at sex and then stalked me. Disgusting person, I do not trust a god damn one of them anymore.
	comment 204: What is there to be suspicious about?? He LIKES YOU!!!!
	comment 205: Nothing better ❤️
	comment 206: I’m married to a guy like that. We’ve been together 29 years so far. 😊
	comment 207: I always assumed it was normal and that I'm weird for not feeling that way. I don't really enjoy anything in the bedroom, so I've always just tried to make it quick and get it over with. I also don't want to run the risk of being asked to do any of it again 🤣
	comment 208: I'm into alot of things but getting a woman off is a favorite for me. Love the sight, sound, and feel of a woman getting off. No idea if it's normal.
	comment 209: It should be, at least.
	comment 210: Sounds like you've found a keeper. I'm lucky that my husband is like this too. We have a great sex life even after 19 years together
	comment 211: My husband is like this getting me off is his favorite thing
	comment 212: I’m sorry what?? That’s how sex should be. Enjoyment is supposed to be mutual, not one-sided.

I think you may have found a keeper.
	comment 213: If he’s a normal man I’m gonna have to go with yes it’s normal.
	comment 214: I do that because it turns me on. I like having my partners want me. It makes my partners take more initiative, which means I don't miss queues. Also just makes me feel like the man and good about myself. Also for me most of the pleasure is really just being aroused and in the moment anyway, getting quick conclusions just ruins all the I could have had by being in a state of arousal.
	comment 215: I’m sorry you’ve had such bad lovers before. Every real man should make his goal to worship his lover into a sex coma of pleasure. Sex is best when our focus is not on ourselves but the other person.
	comment 216: Normal? It's NON NEGOTIABLE
	comment 217: I (m) love it so much. My partner doesn't need that many organs in her life to feel satisfied, but I'd do it as many times as she wanted even if my jaw fell off.
	comment 218: Some of us do. It gives us great pleasure to give our lover pleasure. It can be a turn on to do something well and get positive feedback either verbally or nonverbal.
	comment 219: My ex was like this, unfortunately he had unhealthy tendencies. I wonder what it is with the correlation between good sex and toxic relationships
	comment 220: 100%!!! 

I’m actually shocked by the amount of women post they’re having shitty sex, And haven’t been with a guy since I was 18/19 that wasn’t totally into getting me off first. SO you would think his life depended on it 😂
	comment 221: Yeah my guy’s main goal in bed is to get me off. I have some relationship trauma which can make it hard for me to reach the finish line and he will go as long as it takes, reassuring me the whole time that he just wants to make me feel good. He loves going down on me, possibly more than I enjoy receiving it. Any time he tries something new or different he asks me about it afterwards so he knows whether to do it more often or never again. 

I was with women exclusively until my early 30s. He’s my first male partner and also my first healthy sex life/relationship. I feel like I really lucked out lol
	comment 222: My husband enjoys it. I t makes him happy that I enjoyed it. And he feels proud of his ability to do it.
	comment 223: I guess that might happen if a man is actually into a woman and wants to share the pleasure. Are you complaining?
	comment 224: This is how it should be! There are plenty of shitty men who are only in it to nut, and couldn’t care less about a woman’s pleasure. But a good man absolutely loves giving his woman pleasure! 

Enjoy it!
	comment 225: I love it. I’ll eat it until she’s done. Every time we have sex I will make sure she arrives at least once. It’s not only about my needs, but I make sure her needs are also met.
	comment 226: Plenty of guys do
	comment 227: There’s nothing to be suspicious about. My partner is like this too. They’re sometimes called “pleasers”. Guys like that get off on you getting off. They’re also really motivated to figure out how all your bits and pieces really work.
	comment 228: Yes! Love doing that 😁 I’ve heard it’s not so normal, but just don’t understand that. I genuinely want her to feel great.
	comment 229: I do this with my partner. I find it completely normal. My partner never said anything otherwise and she doesnt have a high sexdrive like I do. However, If anything, if I did stop she would yell at me and ask my why I stopped haha.

Honestly idk if its different for other men or not but even with intercourse. I desire for her to finish before I do. If it doesnt end out that way. Then I still make sure she finishes by other ways such as oral or toys ect. This is like a trophy for me. I did something that left a positive outcome. I was able to make her feel special, wanted, loved and enjoyed. When she smiles I smile.

From what ive gathered, not only does it turn me on more. It also boosts her confidence and she tends to smile so much more afterwards.  But again im one man in this big world so I may be one of the few who sees it this way.

If his intentions are like mine. Enjoy it and appriciate it. 
Hopefuly its all genuine and out of love and appriciation towards you.
	comment 230: 32M, love it. Primary goal 99% of the time.
	comment 231: Personally I am a guy who derives significant pleasure from seeing how partners pleasure, i dont think it’s super normal based off of what other have said to me but we do exist lmfao
	comment 232: is this a fucking joke? is it normal for guys to enjoy getting you off? Yes , for fuck christ sake it's VERY fucking normal. jesus fucking christ, nothing will make me come faster than my partner getting off right in front of me and while I'm the one getting her off. are you in high school or something?
	comment 233: It's not uncommon in my experience.
	comment 234: Literally just did it with the waiif and I couldn’t c*m (been tired, ssri) but i sure as hell was enjoying her c*m on me, literally the best part about it
	comment 235: My boyfriend does this! Idk how normal it is bc I've not really dated that much but it's not abnormal. Definitely not cause for concern.
	comment 236: I don't know if I should really comment on this since I'm a dude, and I can't speak for what's normal for other dudes (personally I just don't usually talk about my sexlife with other guys, and the guys that do generally aren't going into heavy detail especially on the emotional aspect) but like for me the whole point of sex is to get my partner off. I mean, I also don't get any satisfaction out of sex without a well established emotional connection, so maybe I'm just a weird guy.

Like, if I'm into you enough to want to have sex with you, we're well past the point where by default I want to make you feel good and keep you happy, you know?
	comment 237: I love to do that too, my biggest pleasure is the woman having pleasure, there's no other way for me.
	comment 238: I think you forgot a *not in the title….
	comment 239: It should be. I absolutely love making my girl cum.
	comment 240: I can't imagine why it would be any other way. And, yet, as evidenced by many, many posts here and elsewhere, it seems, mystifyingly, that many do not care at all. Why is a mystery. Why wouldn't it be a turn on for your sexual partner to be enjoying themselves? To me, there's almost nothing more erotic than that.
	comment 241: Yes
	comment 242: That’s how I do it.  Making my partner cum is so much fun.
	comment 243: Speaking as a married dude, I've been like that since a teenager.
Why?
Pavloving women,  if my partner cums till they factory reset, odds are they're going to be naked more often.
	comment 244: Yes. I’m men. 
Totally normal.
	comment 245: That moment of "oh, I could just keep this going for a little while" is a good feeling lol it's usually with my hands before anything penetrative. It's weird to hear people say "oh it's so tough to get women to nut", and I'm sitting there like, so did you use your hands or smush your bits into theirs expectantly?

Even following up the hands with P I V is effective, people watch porn and (actual problem) believe it's accurate. You have to touch the washboard, you need to grab her like a bowling ball, and you need to kiss ears, lips, nips, and whatever else your lady likes.  It's legitimately fun, I don't get the confusion
	comment 246: My current partner loves to get me off (and is good at it). 😅 PIV intercourse is bookended by him getting me off before and after. I’m sad to say that he is an outlier in my experiences with men. Most men I’ve been with wouldn’t even eat me out. So many men either don’t care or aren’t good at or confident with the art of making someone with a vagina cum. It’s honestly sad. I’m kind of bummed that I wasted so much time with bad romantic partners and experiences, but better late than never I guess.
	comment 247: That SHOULD be the standard, some men, however, are selfish and don’t care! Some are oblivious. The best are those who care
	comment 248:  Do want or feel you need that after sex O? Or Is he kinda insisting on giving you one?  If yes to the first, if it ain't broke don't fix it. If yes to the second, it could be a warning sign . Tell him no thanks and then see how he responds.
	comment 249: For non-shitty men, yes.

Every single guy I've dated has liked getting me off lol.
	comment 250: If she's not enjoying it, I can't enjoy it, don't understand any other opinion.
	comment 251: Bro it's so dope, like "hell yeah I did that"
	comment 252: Yes, I've had multiple partners who loved it. Someone who is good bed will want you to be satisfied. Enjoy it!
	comment 253: Yeah, I'm gonna brag - but my sex life is fantastic, largely due to his enjoyment in getting me off. Been together 15 years, through some incredibly hard times, but he has always rocked my world.
	comment 254: I love to make my woman cum a lot more than I like to cum
	comment 255: Yes this is normal. When I was dating if a guy didn’t even try then I’d never talk to him again.
	comment 256: Yes, it absolutely is normal. I had to wait until I was much, much older than 21 to discover this. You're really lucky. Your man should enjoy getting you off as much as you enjoy getting him off. It's not all about the PIV for a lot of guys, just like it's not all about PIV for a lot of women.
	comment 257: From what I hear it isn’t normal, but that’s my main goal too.
	comment 258: It is hard to think of something more normal.
	comment 259: doesnt it turn you on to please him? im sure its the same for him. at least it should be. alot of men today suck, but not all of them. the ones you should spare your time for are ones that care for your pleasure like this. it shows he sees you outside of what you can do FOR him.
	comment 260: Hi helicoptering visiting guy here - most of us guys love our partners and love to see them satisfied if possible and reasonable. Don't be afraid to communicate your desire.

That said, when we've done our thing we biologically get a dose of sleepy that may or may not hit hard, so sometimes we're on the clock to get 'it' done before we crash.
	comment 261: My favorite sexual activity is getting my wife off. It's what gets me off. It's not suspicious but isn't the norm.
	comment 262: Oh yes, some men feel satisfied themselves if you are taken care of abd pleasure.
	comment 263: Enjoy it,  There are some of us that enjoy the same thing like he did. I feel bad if the woman I'm sleeping with doesn't have as much fun as I did and I always try to make them cum, sometimes it works
	comment 264: Yes
	comment 265: Yes! Or at least it should be. For both sexes. I love giving my partner so much pleasure they can’t speak. It’s almost selfish of me how much I enjoy it.
	comment 266: If it's weird then I'm not normal. Isn't it better if the people involved want the other people involved to enjoy the act?
I'm sad you have to ask, frankly.
	comment 267: Sounds like you found a rare o e for these times. Back in my day it was a point of pride how many times you could get a woman off and I for one thoroughly enjoy it when I’m the cause of it. There’s really nothing better imo than listening and watching a woman orgasm with you being the cause of it
	comment 268: I mean, personally yeah. I sometimes struggle to orgasm at all, but still have a great time getting my partner off.
	comment 269: I went the first 26 years of my life having partners who didn’t care much that I orgasmed (besides asking me if I came afterwards). In the last year I’ve been with multiple guys who’ve greatly enjoyed getting me off, to the point that they wouldn’t come until I came. It’s been a massively refreshing take. Not sure if i have a better ability to choose the right guys or the younger gen/my gen cares more about pleasing their partner
	comment 270: Yes it's normal, it's pretty hot seeing a girl get off
	comment 271: It should be.
	comment 272: That's just normal.
	comment 273: It's normal and I would say the standard is for men to have every intention of getting their partners off for their own enjoyment, but I would say that the vast majority of men as soon as they get aroused are not able to stick to their intentions and get caught up with their own pleasure. So if you meet a guy like you have, you likely have a good one that has taken the time to practise self-control against one of the most primal urges, which very often trumps the desire to give another pleasure.

You said that even after he has had an orgasm he will still get you off, I personally don't do that, but I do make sure that before I orgasm I make it worth my wife's time 

Sounds like the two of you have fantastic chemistry, enjoy! I hope it works out
	comment 274: Yes!
	comment 275: If he actually causes about you, then yes, but then again, I'm coming from a place where that's something I enjoy doing. It doesn't matter if I do or don't finish (thanks for that lovely side effect antidepressants), making sure whatever partner I'm with finishes is a priority. Maybe 'priority' isn't the right word; I switch to their pleasure/enjoyment as the focus. I actively enjoy being able to make them finish. It is a bit hard to describe other than just saying "getting off by getting them off" kind of statement.
	comment 276: Suspicious of what exactly???
	 comment 277: I came here to ask the same question?
	comment 278: That’s how it should be, after sex when my wife and I are just chilling I’ll do the same for her just because I love it lol. 


I’m one and done usually but I think it’s hot when she will do the same with me, I just enjoy making her feel good. It makes me happy.
	comment 279: Is for me. If they’re not getting off I’m not. I want to pleasure a woman, not be a let down. If I want to pleasure my self I’ll just j*rk off.

I want to be their best or remembered as one of. Not another disappointment or let down.

But not all men are like this based off past girlfriends and friends of mine telling their sexual priorities.

And as egotistical as this may sound it also depends on the woman. The “prettier” or more “into them “ I am, obviously the more effort 😅
	comment 280: I’m a masochist, my partner is a sadist. 

He LOVES getting me off during a play session. And he’s very good at it.
	comment 281: my current partner is this way and it’s literally the first time ever for me…i’m 31 🫠
	comment 282: Yes
	comment 283: I think so!  I've only had a handful of partners as an adult but they all have done a wide variety of pleasurey things.  I'd think if they were just going thru the motions they'd have done the same things each time.
	comment 284: The stereotype is no but there's a lot of us dudes that absolutely want that just as much as we want to get off.
	comment 285: I do.  Even if I don't get off I love getting my wife off as many times as possible.
	comment 286: I can't speak for all men, but it's one of my favorite things. Nothing gets me going more than my wife getting off.
	comment 287: My wife hated it when I admitted that i really enjoyed making her come.  She assumed that I was only giving her pleasure because I got something out of it.
	comment 288: That's normal with a caring partner. It just means he likes you and isn't very selfish.
	comment 289: My most recent sexual partner is like this. He loves getting me off and would have sex and not cum just so he could keep going and not run out of sexual stamina. Very much into getting me to cum over and over again. Just a selfless partner.
	comment 290: Yep, that's what mutually enjoyable sex is like. I'd absolutely use this as a standard from now on, so that if things don't work this is what you'd demand of a future lover.
	comment 291: Aww thats so wonderful! Green flag green flag!
	comment 292: It gets me off getting her off. I try so hard to make her feel safe, comfortable and, if she's able, finished.
It's just too bad there's no "her" for me rn.
	comment 293: Yea, you guys talking about me in here? XD

Idk how common it is, but we exist. I always thought it was just fuckboys that don't care but idk, find someone that cares about you?
	comment 294: I’m in a dry spell rn how dare you post this and make me so jealous
	comment 295: Strange controversial section, must be a lot of insecure men lurking
	comment 296: Sounds like he’s actually a good sexual partner.  I’m sorry you’ve only experienced terrible ones.
	comment 297: Yes!
	comment 298: They sure do. At least the ones worth sleeping with. They know it’s not always easy for women to get off so if they can do it consistently it gives them a real ego boost.
	comment 299: I enjoy helping my wife enjoy herself.
	comment 300: 50/50 tbh
	comment 301: Hell yes all the time! It your partner doesn't come that way try to be the one that turns them into that guy
	comment 302: Not in my experience. Only my ex husband. He actually liked it but every guy I was with before and after him didn’t give a fuck about my pleasure.
	comment 303: its pretty normal, I wouldn't say most guys but pretty close
	comment 304: If they don’t….NEXT!!!
	comment 305: This is the way
	comment 306: Very much yes.
	comment 307: Nothing is more confidence-inspiring that getting my partner off, and I just don't understand many of the selfish lovers that women complain about here.
	comment 308: 49M here.  I love getting my wife off.  Just makes the experience all the better for me knowing she's enjoying.
	comment 309: Yeah, this isn’t unusual most like likely. Sometimes I get too excited getting my partner off, that it makes it hard to control myself. It’s a huge/massive turn on for me to get a woman off,and I used to wonder if it was just me, but I’ve learned over the years, it’s the same for a lot of guys, some guys like to just wanna look after themselves and be done, but I’ve always been into pleasuring a partner, and like I said, it’s huge turn on for some of us.
	comment 310: I enjoy when I perform oral on my wife and she gets off cuz it means I did a good job and when she gets off while we’re doing the horizontal gymnastics. An older player back in the days once told me we’re gonna get off anyways so make sure the woman gets hers. 

How I know she’s getting off biological reactions don’t lie. First I could feel her lower stomach tighten up then her legs start to tighten up and shakes and then she stretches her legs and breathing gets heavy and the scream or loud exhale. And when I’m performing oral she puts my head in a scissor lock and then eventually pushes my head away crying uncle.
	comment 311: If a guy doesn't enjoy getting you off, why are you having sex with him? 

I'll admit, though, that usually it's all before they ejaculate.
	comment 312: In today's episode of "Are the Straight's okay?"...
	comment 313: I’m one of those that like giving please but from the stories I’m told that’s not that common.
	comment 314: You’re lucky!!!
	comment 315: I mean, it’s been normal in all my relationships 🤷‍♂️
	comment 316: I dunno that it's normal, sadly. I'm far more in giving pleasure than receiving, such as skipping getting head, unless the girl insists, while always being eager to go down on my partners. And holding back my orgasm until they cum several times. It was even a bit of an issue with one long term partner who was a "one and done" kind of girl, as I felt unfulfilled. Most of my partners have remarked that's atypical. I haven't really analyzed why I'm that way, but even when I was a virgin I always fantasized about the woman's response over mine.
	comment 317: Is it normal, absolutely. 

Is it the norm? From what I've seen online, sadly it is not.
	comment 318: I do the same, I’ve had a difficult time finishing in the last year because of stress. I love my partner and love making her feel good. So when we are in bed I only focus on her (I still get carried away). It just makes me happy knowing that I’m giving her orgasms (I’m sorry I didn’t know how to phrase this for a response on this sub).
	comment 319: Hetero married male here. Best part about sex is, and always has been, seeing and feeling the pleasurel that making love with her brings her. On the rare occasion that she does not come first, she definitely gets hers in the end, be it by my continuing, manually, or with toys. Unless by then she just isn't into it anymore, then it is cuddle time.

Is the above normal? Hell if I know, but it, or something like it should be.
	comment 320: I’d say it’s been normal with my SO of 12 years   
I did have an ex in the past who never cared to do so hence one of the many reasons his an ex haha  
I dumped him after 2 months for being selfish in bed
	comment 321: Lmao it should be, but unfortunately no. You got hella lucky
	comment 322: It’s not rare for GOOD men, he’s a keeper.
	comment 323: I sure hope it is. My husband will stop doing what he's doing immediately if he thinks that a moan was actually me saying "ow." He really cares a lot about how I feel during sex.
	comment 324: Uhhh…that’s very normal
	comment 325:  😭 girl you won the lottery
	comment 326: I do and I’d like to think I’m normal lol :)
	comment 327: It's normal I guess, I do enjoy pleasuring my partner
	comment 328: Guys are at their most self-centered in their teens. Because of your age, I am assuming most of your experiences were with super self-centered teens who barely understood their own bodies, much less  yours. 

Guys start to get better in their twenties. Both in terms of being thoughtful of their partner’s needs and in their ability to please her. You are reaching the age where you will start meeting more of these kind of guys. At least I hope that happens for you.
	comment 329: Yes. Normal, if not common.
	comment 330: Girl you got a real catch.
	comment 331: This is so depressing - girl finally finds a guy who genuinely likes her and it's "suspicious". I genuinely think we're doomed.
	comment 332: I love eating out! Real men can get off by giving pleasure too, not just receiving!
	comment 333: Suspicious of what?
	comment 334: They should
	comment 335: This should be the norm, if my wife has <2 than it feels pretty disappointing to me.
	comment 336: Is it the norm that guys *aren’t* interested getting a girl to climax?…(speaking as a mostly hetero guy)
	comment 337: I think you should update your prior standards and do with less skepticism...
	comment 338: Does anyone else here get the impression that there are an awful lot of men pretending to be women posting here?

What is this bollocks?
	comment 339: I think it's incredibly normal. People feel proud of their partners orgasms if they had anything to do with it and shame if they didn't get them off.
That itself is something that can turn unhealthy for all sorts of reasons.
But I'd say it's pretty standard.
In fact there is literally no better feeling than causing multiple orgasms. It's a total buzz.
	comment 340: It's so beautiful/hot to look at the person you like having an pleasurable experience.
	comment 341: After all the urgency and tension is gone, getting her off with a cuddle at the end is the best!
	comment 342: That’s how it should be
	comment 343: With no offense intended, I feel it's really sad for the state of humanity that you have to ask this question. However: what is PIV?
	comment 344: Be happy
	comment 345: I enjoy that myself. Partially pleasing your partner, Partially because the control is fun, Partially because it gets me going again. Enjoy your time and/or ask them about it if you can't leave well enough alone
	comment 346: I think most people do like to know they are able to make someone they care about feel good!! It’s something you learn more with age/experience, but good partners (sexual and otherwise) will want to make sure you’re enjoying yourself and feel pleased when they contribute to that!
	comment 347: A little bit like seeing how he treats waiters, how he treats you enjoying it is the most revealing thing.
	comment 348: If you're not already visiting a therapist, you should. A guy doing something you enjoy shouldn't lead you to be suspicious. 

Seek help for your past traumas, and don't sacrifice a relationship because of experiences with previous partners.
	comment 349: It keeps you cumming back ;)
Half joke half not.
	comment 350: u/RonWeasley_is_a_Mood my partner is the same way and we have been together for 17yrs. He was my first real partner so I don’t have anything to compare him to but he’s an incredible person and it showsssss in the bedroom just like it does outside the bedroom!
	comment 351: It is, but repay the favour too
	comment 352: It SHOULD be normal!!!  💯
	comment 353: My first serious bf was like this and after him I never settled for less. It drastically improved my sex life compared to my peers. Only issue is that you won't know who's going to be like that and tell you actually had sex with them, which means I have a bunch of one offs on my roster that make me eye roll when I think of them.
	comment 354: If you got the right man
	comment 355: Think of it this way, if you like someone you want to see them happy. If you're sexually attracted to someone you want to get carnal with them.  Combine those two, aka a relationship.

Personally as a man I also find that my orgasms are the least enjoyable part of sex so it's amazing to watch how world shattering womens orgasms can be and getting to touch/kiss/lick/etc a womans body rules even when my dick has to reboot for 5-15 minutes. 

Also, selfishly speaking; if my partner gets multiple orgasms every time we have sex, they will want to have sex more often.
	comment 356: Yes. I would much rather give head to a woman over receiving. If I want to get off I’ll jerk off. It’s about the shared experience.
	comment 357: What...? 

Yes...????
	comment 358: Men don't really get sexual pleasure as much as women do. A male orgasm is just sad and they can barely feel it outside of their downstairs.

Men get more pleasure from pleasuring their partner. And the ones that refuse to believe so are just bad at sex.
	comment 359: This is normal.  Your exes were abnormal.    Abnormal is unfortunately common especially among men with high misogyny and entitlement which is plenty of them.
	comment 360: Yes it is! For some men anyway. For some it is a real point of pride and a feeling of power in being able to do so rather than just using women as a place to jerk off.

By the way, I have gotten the same basic question from some men. There is a whole history of being taught that women just endure sex so real enthusiasm seems to be a pleasant surprise sometimes.

I suspect it is partially in that some folks don't have empathy, some only do for those they can relate to, and some genuinely want others to be happy as well as themselves. Whether they learned it or just felt that way, it counts in how they treat others including during sex.

Post 5: Food delivery services have me scared.
	comment 1: I've had this happen consistently with male DoorDash drivers and I don't even live in a very populated area -- it's rural, my house is the only one on the road in this particular color, there is no other house they could possibly confuse it with. I always instruct them to leave it at the door.

Most of our local doordashers are women and I've literally never had a problem with them. They drop it at the door and go. The men, though, always want me to come out. One even wanted me to walk out to his car to get the order (this was on a nice sunny day so no adverse weather he might have been trying to avoid).

I usually respond that I'm sick and contagious and chose no contact delivery because of that, but if they'd like to catch it sure I'll come out...suddenly they become able to follow instructions after that. 🙄
	 comment 2: I only ever order instacart when I'm sick.  I've never had a problem like this, but that might be because my orders will include covid tests, OTC drugs, juice, and other things a sick person might want.  I guess they aren't that desperate.

May be a decent way to keep creeps away.  Add a covid test to any order.
	 comment 3: One of the only times I've ever adjusted a tip lower after delivery was the guy that called and said "come out and get your food" then hung up before I could even reply. I called back "I'm disabled and cannot come outside. That's why I ordered *delivery*." and he huffed and hung up without saying anything and finally brought it to the door and tossed it down, visibly annoyed. 

After reading this thread, I'm changing my name in the apps. I wonder if more dudes will find me. If I choose ”no contact, leave at door" and leave instructions where to leave it, why do so many of the guys knock and wait? I'm not opening the door while you're there dude. Sounds like my lesbian ass needs an imaginary male boyfriend to holler to as well.  

It's so much goddamn extra work being a woman sometimes.
	 comment 4: >One even wanted me to walk out to his car to get the order

One dude tried that too. I said why are you a delivery driver if you don't want to deliver. He still sat out there like a fucker. So I reported him for food theft.

Some other guy hid in the dark and said he had to go to another order. I texted that it looked like he was trying to snatch me and he better stop his bullshit. Guess who came trotting out of the dark like a piece of shit with a big smile.

Multiple other males have acted dumb as soon as they pull up outside the complex. They hit the 5 minute timer and expect me to come running. I just text them that I can see them to start a document chain. Absolute assholes.

Zero problems with women.

There's a huge misogyny problem with delivery drivers.
	 comment 5: It's horrible that they just don't wanna follow your instructions until you make them believe they might get sick. Is there an option to report them?

Maybe if the company gets enough reports they might do something with it.
	 comment 6: I always just say I can't bc my dog will bite them. They don't need to know he'd sell me and my entire family for a single cheeto puff.
	 comment 7: > I don't even live in a very populated area

I'm wondering if this makes it worse. I live in NYC and have never, ever had a driver be inappropriate or even spend more than a second doing the drop off.
	 comment 8: Do you get the guys who stand there, knocking and waiting, even when you’ve selected leave at door? I’ve had a few men do this, but only after we’ve spoken on the phone. It never happens to my husband, and has only happened once without speaking to them. Definitely scary
	 comment 9: I will NEVER use third party food delivery. I used to work with a woman who was married to a sex offender. He works for DoorDash. He used to pick her up from work, and he'd park his car outside the door and watch every woman and child walk out. DoorDash didn't give two shits when I complained. There's no way in hell I would want that man knowing where I live. Those companies don't care who they send to your house.
	 comment 10: Right??? Why is it always the men? I showed my boyfriend this post not knowing it got all the attention and he’s disgusted with men/my/our experience. I’m so sorry this happens to you as well. r/wedeservebetter
	comment 11: I had the same things happen. I started getting weird texts from some dude after I had a single meal delivered to the house on a Friday night. I changed my profile to make it look gender neutral so they couldn't tell for sure. All of this stopped.
	 comment 12: I would add to this that a few years ago I shifted anything public facing that I could to be gender neutral in a way that people assume I am a man unless they meet me face to face. My life suddenly got so much easier. Buying cars, dealing with services, social media.
	 comment 13: Me, too. The name people call me isn't clearly gendered. My legal name is. When I use my everyday name, I get no problems. When I use my legal name, it's a toss-up. 

What's really messed up is that my legal name is really old-fashioned, like born in the 1950s kind of out-of-date. Do these people think they're creeping on a grandma? Are they Ben Franklin and think older women are more grateful? Or do they just see older women as potential easy targets for crime? Smh.
	 comment 14: YEP. A nickname for my name can be a male name, and that’s all I use. I stopped having to answer constant calls every time I ordered food because they “couldn’t find my house” even though I have EXTENSIVE notes because I live on a private way.
	 comment 15: Gender neutral names also work for tech support aliases. If the warranty is for Pat Smith they can’t argue that you’re not Pat based on your voice. It’s a stupid form of security anyway.
	 comment 16: Yes, I'd use an old man name, like "Arthur" or "Marvin" lol!

Sucks but ffs life's too short to have to deal with this shit.
	comment 17: i just did this recently and boom, they always come to the door and leave it on the doorstep.
	comment 18: This week I had a male driver send me a picture of our building number the apartment number and of our door all before taking the delivery picture. Then as I waited they went up and down the stairs of our apartment 3 times. My husband wasn't home so I just waited several minutes after hearing them go down the stairs for the last time before I opened the door. I don't usually get delivery when my husband isn't home because this scares me. He always goes to the door when he is home. I don't even know if he knows that this is why. When I told him about the incident this week he was like "That is super weird!"
	 comment 19: Husband's not home=door will not be answered period. My kids and people I like know to text me so I can capture the gremlin before opening the door.
	 comment 20: That sounds a lot more like someones who's fed up of "yea they took the photo showing the order was left but I totally didn't get the order and the photo doesn't technically they prove they left it at my door" than anything nefarious.
	comment 21: I have a fake boyfriend named Jake and whenever there's a guy at the door I always yell something back into my apartment for Jake.  "Jake, the pizza's here!"  I also have a pair of old and worn big men's boots I keep on a mat just inside the door.

Based on something someone posted here, I have started putting Jake's name on orders.
	 comment 22: Jake sounds like an OK dude. Quiet, well behaved, picks up after himself... maybe a little distant, but hey, we all have our flaws. Lol
	 comment 23: Jake even lets you eat all the pizza, what a sweet guy!
	 comment 24: lol my “fake guy” is also named Jake!!!
	 comment 25: does he wear khakis?
	 comment 26: This is awful (that you have to do this) and hilarious. I wonder if you could have a recording that waits about 45 seconds and then starts calling you from the other room. " BABE! HURRY UP, I'm ready!"
	 comment 27: Jake...from State Farm? Sounds hideous!
	 comment 28: Also delivery drivers often put women’s name but are big dudes. I get all the food for my partner who has her name on it, and it’s always weirded me out
	 comment 29: Glad to help.
	 comment 30: i have a unisex name that skews heavily male, and i’m convinced that’s why i rarely have experiences like this with delivery drivers.
	 comment 31: is it Jake from State Farm? 😁
	 comment 32: This a FANTASTIC idea!
	comment 33: I used to get instacart regularly because if I need to grab groceries sometimes it’s easier to order rather than try to rush it after work and pick my daughter up from serff on time. 

I hadn’t felt great one weekend and got groceries delivered. My instructions are “leave at gate “ no. This dude went to the door and just kept knocking. I thought something was wrong, opened the door. He looked me up and down and said “How ya doing cutie?” My husband walked up and said “Great, thanks!” He started backing up, got in his car and peeled out. Dude didn’t even deliver our groceries. He definitely had bad intentions. 

I am not allowed to get instacart anymore. I’m alright with that.
	 comment 34: I would report that to Instacart, the store, and the police.  Technically he stole your groceries, because you paid for them and then he drove off with them.
	 comment 35: Jesus. Sometimes I’m glad I got old and fat. I rarely deal with that bullshit anymore. So many hugs to you and your wonderful husband.
	comment 36: From the other side of things, I'm a woman who used to deliver for those apps and the amount of men that would show up to the door in nothing but boxers was absolutely insane.
	 comment 37: Yeesh, I feel for you.
	 comment 38: It's never the people you wanna see in nothing but boxers...
	 comment 39: Ugh gross. I’m so sorry that happened to you. ❤️
	 comment 40: Ewwwww

&#x200B;

I'm so sorry
	comment 41: Yeah I feel fortunate to have a fiance to send out every time. They love to harass me indirectly. They have gotten mad and refused to give the food to him before. They got fired.
	 comment 42: Why don’t you change your first name to an initial? Worked for me. They don’t need your name.
	comment 43: This is how I feel about Uber/Lyft drivers post Covid. I get these angry men who don’t know how to drive and are creepy and scary. I’ve had to report at least two for nearly causing a crash. That being said I wish we could use our last names or nicknames for food delivery. It would keep people gender neutral and help with not getting someone else’s order with my same name.
	 comment 44: I just changed all my delivery apps (Instacart 🥕,  Door Dash 🚪, & UberEats are all I use) to just my first initial and last name. You can put what you like.
	comment 45: Buzzfeed had another listicle (plagiarized from Reddit ofc) about weird texts with two about creepy delivery drivers hitting on women. 

Only Buzzfeed was sure to put they messaged 'this guy's girlfriend' and 'someone's wife'. Because of course it wasn't women getting shitty messages. It was a man's lady getting harassed. Poor guy
	comment 46: Luckily nothing has ever gone past this (no calls/texts after delivery) but for "contact less" delivery, if the delivery person is a woman, I never get any kind of pre delivery check in, if it's a man, about 60/40 I get a call or text that they can't find my house, they're right out front, etc. It's even more frustrating as most of the time they're on the wrong block to boot. So I'm left wondering if I'm about to get murdered because I wanted sushi or these guys are actually that dumb about following GPS and then looking for the only 12 foot skeleton on my block lol
	comment 47: I used to have an issue where even when I checked "no contact delivery" or put in notes "to leave at the door" they'd still knock until I came out so they could hand it to me. So I started putting a note that if they knock or make me open the door, they're going to have to deal with a very large, protective 185lb dog who will bark (which isn't a lie, he really will) and to just leave it - no contact. Haven't had an issue since
	 comment 48: “They” (idk who they is but i’ve heard) that dogs help with home security. I’ll never be more grateful for my 100 pound dog who hates men (except my SO) and I bring with me if I have to confront a delivery driver. I’m so sorry we have the same experiences, yet I am relieved to have a community that knows the struggle.
	 comment 49: Or just let them knock 🤷🏻‍♂️.   Leave a note that says “don’t be a creep - just leave the items” 

Or just yell through the door “stop being a creep and leave the items” lol.
	comment 50: I work in food delivery and totally believe you, makes me so sad. I've changed my profiles for delivery and rideshares to have only my first initial or a bogus neutral name. Combined with having deliveries left at the door may be a more comfortable solution.
	comment 51: Wow.  That's crazy!  Like, they don't know _anything_ about you except your name and they do that!

I read an article once about two friends that worked together and one was a man and the other was a woman.  For a certain amount of time, I think it was one or two weeks, they took over each other's email accounts.  At the end of their experiment, the guy was just done and said he was sick of all these people second-guessing everything he wanted to do and disagreeing with him all the time.  The lady said it was the most productive she had ever been in her career...
	 comment 52: I read about that!  How amazing, lol.
	comment 53: This is scary and something I’ve never realized because my husband is always the one doing the ordering. Now I have a new fear unlocked.
	 comment 54: Have him sign into his delivery accounts on your phone, so that his accounts can be used if you ever want to order food on your own. That way it will still look like a man ordering.
	comment 55: I have a gate and cameras. I have to let them in so I make sure they leave before I open my door.  It happened ever since one delivery Uber driver was so insistent I come open the door. When I opened the door, he peeks his head and foot inside my doorway into my home and looks around. I live in an affluent area and I have cameras all over with lights so I didn’t feel unsafe but uncomfortable. I am a cat person but sometimes I think about getting a very protective dog. 🐕
	 comment 56: >foot inside my doorway

Oh, HELL no. I keep a can of pepper spray by my door due to a nasty encounter with a neighbor over their dog. I will *empty* that fucker on anyone who tries that shit with me. They will rue their existence,  as I will definitely call the cops too, all while they are writhing in agony on my stoop. That's an attempted home invasion. These fuckers are trying to get shot; in the US no one knows who's packing.
	 comment 57: My dog is a big and loud doofus. I never tell any delivery men or contractors the latter part.         
Ironically the cat is more likely to swipe at a stranger.
	comment 58: My wife ordered some food under her name, and the delivery guy was sending the same kind of messages about coming to the door, etc. I was home with her, and she had the great idea for me to open the door with the stereo blaring "Goodbye Horses" in the background. Delivery guy dropped the food and split. She puts the orders under my name now.
	 comment 59: Please tell me you wore a pink satin robe and a feather boa when you did it
	 comment 60: GENIUS!
	comment 61: This is why my uber is connected to my dad's.  He gets messaged every time I get in a car, and often foots the bill lol
It means I have to message him and transfer the money every time I get out, but it definitely gives us both peace of mind
	comment 62: We use my partners name on my delivery account. The only times it’s been an issue is with work trips (my Grubhub is me, DoorDash isn’t). They always want me to walk out. Instacart has actually scared tf out of me by refusing to leave and continuing to bang on the door!


I shouted at them for it and they left. I am currently sick with Covid. Anyone tries that tonight I’ll be like “um sure you want Covid?” Lol. (I am ok, just feel like I have a bad cold. We are lucky it’s mild. Partner has it too so I’m not stuck by myself…)
	comment 63: I suspect that this is less of a problem in areas where even a small percentage of customers make a point of reporting worrisome behavior by drivers. 

I've only had to report a driver once.  Took me to the wrong entrance of a huge park (over a km from where I was meeting my friend) and then asked for payment in cash.  Which explains why he didn't know exactly where my drop point was -- he'd reported me as a no show and never logged the ride.
	 comment 64: I had a couple of Grab (local Uber equivalent) drivers try to pull this stunt and then they got really arsey when I said no to taking me to my destination with no booking/reporting me as not showing up. 

I made a point after this to take pictures of my meet point and my booking screen and the next time someone tried doing the whole no-show/I’ll still take you but pay in cash thing, I just reported it to their customer service line.
	comment 65: noticed this as well; i'm a trans woman, before i transitioned, (during early covid), they would leave it on the bench/chair outside my apartment (per the instructions). now, when i order under my new name, they always ring the doorbell and hand it to me, despite instructions to leave on the chair outside.
	 comment 66: In case no one has told you, or mentioned it, it is entirely ok to make them leave it by your door. Don't answer the door if you don't want to. They ring my bell all the time but I'll look through the peephole and wait until they're gone before opening it. I'm also pretty abrasive and not afraid of confrontation so I will 100% yell at someone if they did anything dumb (no one has yet). Obviously, look out for yourself and only do what you feel is safe enough to do
	 comment 67: It would be especially prudent for a trans woman to use initials or something gender neutral considering how dangerous it has become for trans folk in recent years.
	comment 68: This is exactly why I never order in.. was always concerned about this bs
	comment 69: My husband's name is on the account and our house description is "the house eith all the pine trees and big tree in middle of the yard. Please put order on bench under the front window"
	comment 70: Yeah it’s one reason I use an initial or fake male name on my delivery profile. When I moved in with my husband I realized how often drivers got lost. But it was a legitimate reason for our complex cuz the apartment buildings all looked the same and only had a number on one side of the entrance. Each building had the same layout and apartment numbers so stuff would be delivered to the wrong building. If it was night time I’d tell him he needed to go out and meet the driver or find him because I wasn’t going. 

Previously I lived in a condo where most drivers just dumped the food on a counter in the lobby and leave so I’d go down later and get it.

One time I had a driver insist I come out and get the food myself and they wouldn’t come in. I found out it was a female driver. So I changed my opinion on how inconvenient that was as I get it, she probably didn’t want to buzz and walk up to my apartment door either in case she was in danger.
	comment 71: My profile pic is of me and my husband and now I’m wondering if that cuts down on creeps. They know there’s a good chance I’m not alone.
	 comment 72: I have my husband in all my profile photos that aren't for work. I noticed a dramatic drop in creeps since doing it.
	comment 73: In the comments I started putting that I have a very reactive dog and want to avoid them getting bit. Surprise surprise suddenly no drivers had an issue just leaving my food at the door.
	comment 74: I had my dads name on my Uber acct before I lived with my boyfriend for this reason specifically. Anytime I take a ride no matter where I’m going, I’m meeting up with my dad/big brother/boyfriend.
	comment 75: As a driver of these apps, specifically Doordash and Grubhub, I am *begging* all of you to *please* report and leave negative reviews of bad drivers. They can have their account deactivated from too many complaints and bad reviews, and if they wanted to create a new account, they would have to use someone else's account, which can also get them deactivated. Every single time it happens, please leave a review and file a complaint with the delivery service.
	comment 76: Yeah I only order when my bf is over and he always goes to the door to get the food. I am paranoid and don’t order delivery alone.
	comment 77: There's a doordash delivery account that every time they deliver its two dudes, and they just stand there for like a minute. I've stopped ordering during the times I tend to see them because it freaks me out, especially since I live alone.
	comment 78: When my wife and I are out together if she orders an Uber or Lyft we definitely get a better response than if I do. Both men and women drivers apparently prefer picking up a woman, though probably for significantly different reasons.
	comment 79: This fuckin sucks. I've seen this issue posted elsewhere many times and it pisses me off. In addition, my wife doesn't feel safe going to the door either .

Here's what works for us:

Always put a male name on the order

Get a doorbell cam 

If your man can't answer the door and you must, answer the door while recording video of the delivery dude with your phone

Before you open the door yell out to your SO "Delivery is here, honey!"

That's it IIRC 

It pisses me off that my wife has to do this when I'm not around
	comment 80: I have not had this happen but in my instructions, it says “Crazy dog. Leave food at door and ring bell.”
	comment 81: I’ve had food delivered to my apartment and to my hotel. For my apartment, I used the restaurant’s delivery service. For the hotel, I used UberEats. The driver for the restaurant’s delivery service was very professional and kept his distance since I chose contactless delivery. The hotel’s policy is for the food to be delivered to the lobby and I would come down to pick it up. 

I’m so glad for both the contactless delivery option and the hotel’s policy, because I sure don’t want random men knowing where I live!
	comment 82: This is so scary thank you for posting this
	comment 83: it's because everybody knows that women are hopelessly befuddled and fuzzy-minded. you definitely don't want to try following a woman's delivery instructions, you can guarantee that they'll be too vague.

plus this is why it's always better to ask a man. especially don't ask a woman who is so befuddled as to think she's an 'expert' just because she has a degree or experience, whatevs.

/s /s /s
	 comment 84: Oh goodness, golly me. I didn’t realize I ordered food! Please, struggle to find a normal address and ask me a million questions. 

//ss
	comment 85: Only had this happen once, during lockdown I ordered stuff to my ex's parents place. Delivery guy walked around the house into their backyard and was knocking on the glass patio door to the living room like some lunatic. They were obviously terrified.
	comment 86: I guess I'm just used to having to go pick up orders due to growing up in the middle of nowhere with no delivery services that I just auto state I'll pick up my orders even though deliveries are available in my current area. I've seen way too many true crime stories, articles and other women's stories regarding shady ass drivers. It is just safer for these drivers not to know where you live.
	comment 87: As a woman with a gender neutral name (which is more often given to boys) I've thankfully never had this issue. But it's good to be aware the creeps are out there.
	comment 88: My husband has a name that could be woman's, so we use my cat's name. Lol. It's amazing (in a bad way) how many drivers would call me or try to get me to come out of my house when my name was on the account compared to now.

Unrelated, but related to bad driver behavior. I live in a cul de sac. Once, instead of backing out of my driveway, a driver turned out of my driveway onto my neighbor's lawn, drove across it to get to his driveway, and pulled out from there. 

I still don't know what she was thinking. We live on the quietest, deadest road. Its not like she would have backed out into traffic.
	comment 89: Okay, so I'm a single woman.  I just signed up for no-contact delivery and put where I want it in the notes section of the apps.  No one ever contacts me despite my very obvious feminine name.
	 comment 90: I'm not single but same! I've got an obviously female name but set mine to no contact delivery and never have any issues. The only exception is the pizza place that uses door dash for delivery but order thru the gas station app. That doesn't have a no contact option so they knock.
	 comment 91: Me too.  But I live on the fourth floor of my building, so they're probably relieved to see the note to "leave the stuff on the bench in the glass entranceway to the lobby".  A few times, a man or a woman delivered to my door. I assumed they didn't read the instructions; I gave them some additional tip money for going the extra mile and saving me from having to leave my apartment to go downstairs to get my food/groceries.  

But I live in an access-controlled building in a large liberal city, where I feel anonymous and safe.
	comment 92: I have an alternate gmail account just for not appearing feminine when interacting with the public - conveniently my initials form a common "guy name" abbreviation - think "AJ Smith" or "JR Adams" - so most people assume male. Only folks I know and very trusted businesses (my credit union, for example) get my "Alice J Smith/Joanne R Adams" gmail.
	comment 93: This blows my mind as a male. I’m sorry that you guys have to go through this. I don’t even think twice about it (except how expensive it is)
	comment 94: I got into a verbal altercation with an UberEats driver that really, really wanted to know my unit number.

Lol, that's not information you need. My building has a gate. My delivery instructions say to leave it at the gate.

Ended up arguing on the sidewalk (outside of the gate) before he would give me my food.
	comment 95: Yea, our food delivery service is under my SO's name. I don't have issues with my groceries because I always order through (safeway) my local store that actually hires their own drivers who deliver with a refrigerated truck. Drivers are nice and professional, and if I don't have alcohol then the groceries are just left with no interaction. Sometimes they outsource to Doordash, but it's not very often unless I order with a 1 hour window (vs. I usually do a 4 hour or 2 hour window)
	comment 96: This is why my daughters and I don’t use delivery services with our real names.
	comment 97: We live in a super confusing complex, I deal with this a lot. It definitely happens more when I use my name vs my husband’s. Super annoying. 

I’ve gotten the delivery instructions down to a science, and I don’t even give them a chance to ask me to come get it. I’m super nice, but if they say “hey I’m by the garage I can’t find you” I’ll cut them off before they can even ask, and give directions to us from where they are. I make it clear that I’m not coming down to meet them. 

We also got remote controlled porch lights that blink rainbow colors, so that makes it even more obvious (and leaves less room for bullshit).
	comment 98: As someone who does deliveries as a side gig I only ask questions if I have to and have my delivery update texts that’s it. Maybe it’s because I am woman and have no desire to harass any of my fellow human beings. Like I don’t get why they do this, sorry they do this to you. My go to on apps was I wrote the gender neutral shorten version of my name, seemed to help.
	comment 99: Possibly report every driver who does this.  For gendered assumptions or gender aggression
	comment 100: This is not the first time I’ve heard of male delivery drivers seeing a female name and being a creep. If we ever sign up for them, I’m using my first initial or a gender neutral NN
	comment 101: Luckily I use a male name always since I’m a trans man so this never happens to me. Fucked that it might if I used something feminine though
	comment 102: I’m very grateful that I have a generally unisex but traditionally male name for this reason. One time one of my delivery drivers dropped off my order but forgot my drink, so I called and spoke to them and they said they’d run out to their car and be right back with it. They were also surprised that I was a woman. Despite the fact that it was a no-contact order and they initially dropped off my no contact food just fine, after they came back with my drink they knocked and knocked until I opened the door for them and took the drink from them personally.
	comment 103: Wow that is crazy because I have this happen fairly often as well. Just a few weeks ago I ordered delivery and the Dasher wanted me to come outside to flag me down and my mom was so worried since it was fairly late, around 9PM. It happens fairly often so I thought nothing of it. 

My complex is only so big and everything is lit up and I always give descriptive directions which is why it’s annoying when it happens. I kind of want to change my name on the app to see if I notice a difference.
	comment 104: There is seriously a whole discussion to be had about how men are not adapting well to traditionally feminized labor like grocery shopping and putting a meal on the table in some way.

I sympathize with gig drivers who are afraid of a parking ticket or are beating the clock on five deliveries in the same apartment complex. Mine is really confusing if you don’t know the place so I leave VERY clear directions where to find my gate or where they can just leave the bag with security so I can go downstairs for it (easier for all parties).

It’s literally never been a woman driver who’s had trouble finding my address following my directions. Men have hubris about navigation then spend 15 minutes on the phone with me as I tell them where to go, when they could’ve skipped all that if they paid attention to the note.

But they WILL if it’s a guy who orders, apparently!
	comment 105: Wow that's crazy. I hope you're reporting all these people. I'm also curious to know where you and everyone else is from here. I've never had uncomfortable situations like this in Australia. The ONLY thing I've ever been asked is if they are at the right apartment entrance! Which is still silly imo because the names are on the doors but welp, I guess people can be easily confused💀
	 comment 106: Me too, I'm in NZ and haven't heard many stories like this. I get the sense being a woman in the US is much more dangerous (especially with guns and conservative men around) and for the most part I assume people on Reddit are from the US
	comment 107: i've had this issue with instacart too! stuff like men openly flirting while texting me, not even to discuss the order but just going from small talk to "so are you single?" sorts of convos. it's so bizarre bc i'm pretty sure instacart doesn't even use profile pictures for customers, so they're just going off my name alone since one guy had commented "i bet you're cute" or something like that..hoping they don't have photos, at least, given that. freaky as hell. 

i've seen women say stuff like they send their bfs/husbands but we shouldn't have to rely on having a man around just to feel safe :\
	comment 108: I order delivery for myself and my BF all the time. Never had this issue. It's under my name, no pictures of me. Also in the notes for the driver, I say leave it on the table inside the patio. Usually that's what happens, sometimes they'll go to the back door or the wrong house. The few times someone actually came to the door, I used our eufy doorbell to tell them where to leave it. We have 3 cameras that show the person and their car. So if anything should happen we can report it. I am sorry this is happening to anyone. Please report it to the company, get security cameras and if needed, call the police.
	comment 109: I changed my name to my nickname which is largely used by males and get literally zero extra communication now. Got it all the time prior to doing this. Notes always said to leave on porch- do not knock  and had several scenarios where the driver would ignore that and knock, ring or call.
	comment 110: I don't know how much it has helped me avoid these situations but my delivery notes say "don't knock or ring the doorbell. It will get the dogs riled up." Usually the delivery person will follow those instructions but like ninety percent of the time, the person who doesn't is a man.
	comment 111: As a woman who is a delivery driver, this shit is so gross and the best advice I would give is to stop using third party apps. They're bad for customers for these exact reasons - little to no accountability, and they are bad for workers. In the long run, they are contributing to the systemic issues that further inequality. 

Order from places that use their own in house delivery if you can. Those places, at the bare minimum, will know exactly who delivered your food. At places I have worked, we even go so far as to instruct the people who answer the phone to verify addresses by asking the customer to verify rather than saying "this is to 123 Main St?" on the off chance someone is trying to, for example, find the current address of an ex girlfriend. 

As a woman, there's safety in the accountability provided by ordering from a place that employs its own drivers. "Independent contractors" are rarely held accountable, especially in situations like you are talking about.
	comment 112: During lockdown, my husband signed up for Instacart and DoorDash and always selected contactless delivery and gave instructions because our house number is easily confused with the neighbors. He has a male name, and some delivery people STILL rang the doorbell and waited or would go to the wrong house (despite us specifying it is literally the corner house with a specific color door).
	comment 113: I order several time a week and this has literally never happened to me. Not even once. I wonder if it's because I have a stereotypical 1970s white girl name so they realize it's going to be an older lady? Maybe the 1960s suburban neighborhood I live in is more associated with older people and/or families? I have no explanation. I'm sorry this happens so much to other women!
	comment 114: I had one text from one dude praising me for my great directions but otherwise they just leave things at my neighbour's unit instead of mine. Thankfully no dudes trying to get me to come outside and meet them yet.
	comment 115: I use a male associated name when I order delivery for anything now. It's definitely better.
	comment 116: I'm convinced at this point that a lot of young, socially stunted, single men become food deliverers solely with the crooked fantasy that they'll somehow meet the girl of their dreams in that line of work. Within that typical socially stunted fashion, they try to maximize their number of interactions with women thinking that somehow, someday that one girl they always fantasized about will magically throw herself into his arms with no reason or cause. It's sad, terrifying and bothersome.

Delivery services should do more against this kind of behavior. It also makes me worried that they (the deliverers) may do uncouth things to my food, with the sick machination of 'something of theirs' ending up inside of me through the food. Though maybe I'm being too paranoid worrying about that.
	 comment 117: Pizza delivery and porn is a stereotype.
	comment 118: My woman orders food using our male cats name. Similar bullshit
	comment 119: Have they been watching porn where the studly delivery driver ... delivers?
	comment 120: I have my doubts about how experienced and/or intelligent some of these deliverers are. The ones hired by some business (Amazon/UPS/Pizza Hut/etc) never have a hard time finding my place, whereas the self-employed ones are the ones who always struggle. And I'm a guy.
	comment 121: As a current p/t DD driver, I don't disagree with any of these comments I just want to remind you if you order cigarettes or alcohol to use your real name even if you don't want to.  We have to ask for  ID when delivering those.  

FWIW, if you leave clear instructions as the OP it shouldn't really be hard.  Even in areas where the homes look the same.
	comment 122: Weird. I live in a large city, and I’ve never once had this happen to me. The only time someone ever called was a woman, and she was standing on the even side of the street looking for an odd house. 🤦🏻‍♀️

I’m so sorry so many of you are having this experience, though.
	comment 123: I only use DoorDash, and I always have no contact order ticked. I don't even communicate with my driver 99.9% of the time, and when they do message me, it's to tell me they're on their way, or the wait time is going to be long, or that an ingredient isn't in stock. That's entirely unprofessional and should be reported to whatever app they deliver for.

	 comment 126: Did you even read the post and the responses so far?
	 comment 127: oh, f off. read my comment, where my deliveries literally changed after i transitioned from male to female, including changing my name.
	 comment 128: [removed]
	comment 129: This is very subjective and I don't feel related to what gender name is displayed. My husband has always been the name on our delivery. We also have always had detailed notes. We lived in duplexes where the maps would say you arrived once you pulled in. Detailed directions, explaining that the maps app is wrong didn't matter. We put up with hell the entire time we lived there. Since purchasing a house? Absolutely no issues. 

What you are experiencing is a rash of drivers who do not read notes. Immediately followed by ones that have. That is all.

ETA: That isn't to say creepy behavior doesn't happen, it's more likely this though. Do hope the trouble stops.
	comment 130: I order door dash constantly and never had a male delivery person ask me weird questions. Actually, one did ask me to come to his car to get my food, and I got pissed and told him it's his job to deliver to my door. But when he came, he was clearly VERY disabled. He was heavily relying on a cane and his legs were disfigured. I felt HORRIBLE for being such a B.
	comment 131: I mean, that's weird, but if they wanted to hurt you, they know where you live and they have access to your food. Surely they would have... idk, applied LSD to the inside of the straw on your drink? By now? Maybe they just want attention that bad, which is creepy but not life threatening.
	 comment 132: Life threatening stalkers usually start out as merely creepy.
	 comment 133: Maybe they just want to be creepy, or get a rush from talking to a woman. That doesn’t excuse it.

Uggh no
	comment 137: I use GrubHub pretty often and even though I have no contact delivery and instructions to just leave the food on my porch, I always always ALWAYS have drivers calling me first before they're even on my block. I don't answer anymore, but sometimes they'll call multiple times anyway, then ring my doorbell and wait. I just found it all incredibly annoying and figured it was just people not reading the instructions... Never thought that my not gender-neutral name would have to do with it. Ughhhhhh. I resent that changing my display name is a possible solution (like lying and telling men you have a boyfriend instead of just saying you're not interested in them specifically) but I'm going to try it anyway.
	comment 138: Yup I had the same experience!! No more issues now that my name is “Nelson”
	comment 139: Wow, thank you for sharing. For whatever reason, I'm often mistaken as a man when people haven't met me, because my name is unusual. Our apartment can genuinely be difficult to find because we're in a densely populated urban area and not immediately visible to street view, so I give instructions about house color and which porch to leave it on, and what that porch looks like, but that's it. 

I've never been asked questions like you have, other than just clarifying where it is (because lots of houses are the same color, and ours is on a busy street, easy to miss), and for all the creepy shit I do deal with in my neighborhood, I never realized how having a seemingly not-obvious-gender name was secretly helpful in these kinds of experiences. 

Sending this post to my husband.
	comment 140: I’m so sorry. It’s so infuriating. I’m a female delivery driver and can confirm similar bullshit comes from the male customers as well.
	comment 141: I use my nickname which is usually a masculine name. Way less issue.
	comment 142: oh yeah, i've heard this over and over endlessly about all food delivery services. our household delivery service is in the male roommates name for this reason.
	comment 143: I had covid a few months back and told the pizza guy to put it on the roof of my car.  He complied thankfully.  

When I was a kid it was just me and my mom and little sister at home and some pushey sales man stood at the door yelling how he knows we are home.  I believe he eventually left but yeah we had to hide in a bedroom.  My dad was at work and you bet your soul he would not have pulled that crap with a six foot tall man.

Post 6: Getting iced....
	comment 1: “You can be friendly, or polite, or tell me you need space. You don’t get to disrespect me and be awful.”
	 comment 2: Seriously, what the fuck - this is not even REMOTELY appropriate or acceptable behaviour from anyone in a relationship. 

If he wants to be a sucky baby, he can go do that on his own time. He doesn’t get to treat his WIFE like a coworker that he despises. Hell, if he pulled this shit in a workplace he’d likely get written up or reprimanded. Fuck this guy and his bad attitude.
	 comment 3: Exactly. My wife does this all the time; if she's in a bad mood, she'll put on a smile for everyone but she'll be an absolute ass to me. A few years in I started to tell her that she's allowed to be in a bad mood, but she's not allowed to treat me without basic human dignity and respect.
	 comment 4: This right here.
	comment 5: Do you have friends or family you can go hang out with? You don't have to stay there and be treated like shit all night. He wants to be left alone. Take him at his word. Go out. Have some fun. Get some time to yourself. Recharge your batteries. You deserve it!

If he's still in a big snit when you get home, get in your comfy jammies, get some popcorn and settle in with a good movie. You don't need to be around that energy. Stop trying to figure out what's bothering him or whether it's your fault. It's definitely not your fault he's choosing to act like a moody teenager. If he were an adult, he'd just tell you what's bothering him.

In the mean time, you can leverage your silent treatment to do some self care and look after your own needs. His bitchy mood is not your problem.
	 comment 6: My husband struggles with depression, anxiety and depression. Occasionally when he misses his meds too many days in a row, he turns into The Incredible Sulk and is a complete asshole. I used to try and figure out what's wrong. Now I flat out tell him I didn't do anything to deserve him being an asshole to me, so he can either be nice or he can go the fuck away. And if he chooses to be a dick, I ignore him all day and go do whatever I want, and then he sulks more because he wanted to go out and do errands with me and I abandoned him. Then he gets reminded to use his words because I am not a mind reader, and when I did ask earlier what he wanted to do, he rolled his eyes and said idk like a teenager. 

Basically, the longer we are married, the less time I have for his bullshit. I love him, and want him to live a happy and fulfilling life, but I can't make him take his meds, leave the house, or remove the giant stick from his ass. He has to want to do those things, and he doesn't get to be mean to me when he's actually hating himself. I'm not here to be his emotional punching bag. It's not my job to regulate his emotions. I can encourage him to take positive steps, I will give ideas, I will support his choices, and give him options, but some days, he just wants to be a grumpy asshole, and on those days I go shopping and get lunch, and get my nails done, and generally do things that make me happy.
	 comment 7: Ha! I had a bf in college who would pull mysterious suck attacks occasionally. I took the opportunity to go out with friends and have the best time. I figured I could handle it because I wasn’t letting it affect me. But I finally realized he was ridiculously immature with zero coping mechanisms and I didn’t want to deal with that long term.
	 comment 8: Perfect answer is perfect.
	 comment 9: Quality advice
	 comment 10: This is exactly how I’ve dealt with the same situation! decide to say fuck it and do my own thing without worrying what he’s up to.
	comment 11: I feel like that sort of thing is kind of abusive, purposely icing out someone in the family to hurt them is fucked up. If he's upset with you he needs to be a good partner and address it. If he's not then he can at least explain why he's bring cold only to you. I'm sorry, I know this feeling and it's so hurtful.
	 comment 12: The silent treatment is abusive. It’s a favorite of narcissists.
	 comment 13: It isn't kinda of abuse it is abuse. The silent treatment from your partner activates the same area of your brain that is activated by physical pain. In short, it's like getting beat by your partner but without visible bruises. It also can cause psychological and physical side effects it can cause behavioral changes ie "what am doing wrong," "what did I do," "what can I do  to fix it," "how can I change to fix it".
	comment 14: This is not normal behavior.  There are ways to communicate that you wish to be left alone. Honestly with this kind of reaction I’d be wondering what happened while he was out on the grocery run.  This sounds like a Discard. 

I like my alone time and I get overwhelmed a lot by people when I’m already stressed. I’ve never spoken to a partner like that. Ever. Even when I’ve felt that it’s none of their business and just wanted to be left alone. 

This man is punishing you for something.  He’s making it obvious by the way he’s being “warm” to the kids.  I recommend checking out the Chump Lady site and seeing if any of the stories there resonate with you.

	comment 20: Are you reading what you've written? I wouldn't tolerate that behaviour from a friend, much less a partner. Fuck everything about this.
	comment 21: You can have all the space you want, but I don’t deserve to be blatantly disrespected and dismissed by you when you can clearly muster up some warmth for our children to not feel completely unloved.
	comment 22: YOU DESERVE BETTER. This is a horrible example to set for your children.
	comment 23: There is nothing lonelier than getting treated like this by someone you're supposed to be able to trust. And don't gaslight yourself about this for him, this is him firebombing you and your relationship, that's a choice he's making. He was having FEELINGS and he was being VULNERABLE and acting on them and he feels entitled to do that to you because you married this guy and he feels entitled to BE AUTHENTIC and not HIDE HOW HE FEELS with you, I'm sure that's going to be the story. It's ridiculous. You're not tissue for him to blow his nose into, you're a human being he's committed to, the mother of his children, and he's absolutely NOT entitled to lash out at you.

That thing where dudes show up on reddit and complain about being rejected for HAVING FEELINGS: here it is, this is what they're doing that's losing them relationships and respect.

This isn't "having feelings", this is about feeling entitled to dump their worst impulses on you and expect you to never hold them accountable for the consequences.

Of course you feel terrible, he's treating you like you don't deserve basic kindness. You wouldn't treat a stranger this way. He's doing this because he believes that you're a safe target. Men believe that's what it means to be in a relationship with a woman, you get to do shit like this. It's not okay.

Whatever happens next, I really hope you don't just forgive him. He needs to earn forgiveness over time through re-earning the trust he just shattered.
	comment 24: This is not “kinda normal” at all. This is abuse. Don’t put up with it. Tell him his behavior is not acceptable and to stop it. If he can’t stop he can leave.
	 comment 25: That was my thought as well. He keeps saying “leave me alone” but he’s the one who needs to leave until he can be a decent human. Being in a mood is one thing, punishing a partner trying to help is unacceptable.
	comment 26: "husband, I understand that something is bothering you and you're unable to communicate that to me at this time.

As you know, the sooner you address an issue with me, the sooner it can be resolved and the longer you wait, the more it becomes unfixable.

 It is important that you let me know the high level details of this so that we can continue to work as a team, otherwise, if I don't understand the reason why you're treating me differently than the rest of the family, I will also be disengaging. From tonight on I will be sleeping at [insert location wherever]. Please communicate with me only via text."
	comment 27: Mine gets like this when some random asshole at work pisses him off. Like why take it out on the person who is happy to see you????? I proceed to treat him the exact same way he is treating me until he breaks down and apologizes. I'm more stubborn so I can hold out longer.
	 comment 28: I just tell mine I didn't do anything to deserve to be treated like that, so he can stop being an asshole anytime now. Then depending on his reaction, we either have a decent night or he hides in the basement and I get to choose what I want to watch on TV.
	comment 29: He's entitled to feel however he feels. He's *not* entitled to passive-aggressive behavior. He needs a time out until he can play nice with others.
	comment 30: My ex bf once said whenever someone in a relationship starts being nit picky with the other partner, degrading them, picking fights, etc. it’s often because they cheated or otherwise feel guilty about something. 

I agree with other comments to send him a note or say something to him in the vein of give me a high level overview of what is upsetting you now and we can hash it out later. If he refuses to communicate then give him space and have a serious conversation later about how icing someone out is abusive. It is totally okay to need space especially if you’re stressed about something but that should be communicated up front.
	 comment 31: Yes I wondered why a second trip to the grocery store was needed.
	comment 32: Your kids are seeing this behavior and  might repeat it somehow in their adult relationships. They might be like him or put up with someone like him. They are learning that it's ok. They are seeing you treated like crap and how you handle it. 

You deserve better.
	comment 33: Any chance he could be cheating?  My ex treated me like crap any time he was with another woman.  He had to be upset with me to justify the adultery in his head.
	 comment 34: Yep, exactly. I couldn't understand why he changed so dramatically. He went from being my friend to acting like he couldn't stand being in the same room with me.
	comment 35: That's emotional abuse
	comment 36: I know marriage isnt perfect but if your husband is casually and callously telling you to leave him alone, I’m sorry but that dude doesn’t like you.
	comment 37: OP, I hope you don't give this behavior any additional attention.. Enjoy things that you like to do which don't involve him and have fun!  
I also want to add: he doesn't get to make all the decisions regarding your attention. He's saying to leave him alone without giving you any sufficient reason, that's rude but ok you go have fun.  But if I wear you, I would not shower him with attention when he's ready either.  He can have attention when I am ready... He doesn't get to call all the shots. 
Lastly, the very next thing we would talk about is his crummy behavior and what I'm expecting next time he needs alone time. His bad mood should not spill on me unnecessarily.  Overall, I would make it super inconvenient for him to treat you badly (partly by having fun without him, partly by continuing to have fun without him even when he's ready to join the fun, and partly by withholding any fun till there's been a serious conversation about behavioral expectations). Good luck!
	comment 38: Never mind feeling unloved… why on earth are you tolerating to be treated this way and abused in your home and in front of your children??
	comment 39: This behaviour should never be normal, even if swamped at work. He needs to be told that behaviour is unacceptable, but you both need to sit and talk it through.
I never treat my partner like that even if I'm mentally overwhelmed, since she's only showing concern for me. Nip that behaviour in the bud ASAP!
	comment 40: Ughhh hopefully I’m projecting and this isn’t what’s really happening but….he may be having an affair. Wayward Spouses (WS) often project their unhappiness onto the betrayed spouse (BS). I sincerely hope I’m wrong
	 comment 41: I hate to agree with you, but... I agree with you. This is how I realized my husband was having an affair. The fact that OP's husband went out (for a second grocery run?) and came back in a miserable mood with all of his firepower pointed right at OP alone gave me such flashbacks. I could feel the panic rising.
	comment 42: Be icy right back. Don’t let this man speak to you that way! Stop caring ab any of his needs or having any interest in his life. If he’s not going to be considerate, why should you? What’s the worse that could happen for real bc this sounds awful. He wants to be a problem, become a bigger problem. These men gotta learn I swear
	comment 43: He gets to have feelings. He gets to withdraw emotionally. You don’t have to carry the weight he’s dumping on you. His emotions are not your fault and they’re not your responsibility. Don’t take it personally. When he’s willing to chat, you can let him know a more appropriate way that he can inform you that he needs space. Whatever he’s stewing about is his to deal with. 

I’ve been socialized to always smooth things over and took on wayyyyy too much of his discomfort. If he needs some different from you, he’s gotta say it.
	 comment 44: I lived this way for 20 years, and y'know what, it is not acceptable. 

Yes, everyone gets to have feelings, but withdrawing, icing out YOUR PARTNER, cannot be one's way of dealing with it, without ever then debriefing when one is feeling more normal. That leaves the empathetic partner in the dark and emotionally isolated, which is fuckin torture. This is a person one has chosen to spend ones life with, and if one can't figure out a way to articulate their feelings when they are so clearly impacting the other, that is something that needs to be addressed. 

Now, we agree on one thing: in OPs case, it's up to the husband to figure out how to address this. But silence absolutely is not a long term answer, especially when he's still being kind and warm with others right in front of her.
	 comment 45: No, this isn’t okay behaviour. He is clearly punishing her.
That is not okay behaviour ever. He’s an adult, yes his emotions are his responsibility, but he cannot treat her like this. Especially in front of their children.
	 comment 46: You get to have feelings, but you don't get to treat your wife like trash while having those big feelings. He needs to learn how to regulate his emotions. It is not her job to regulate his big feelings.
	comment 47: As a permanently single 51-yr old woman...why? This is your future? Your "partner"?

Nah. I can sit on my couch, cuddling a pup and cats with all my self-respect intact. 

I can't imagine letting a man dictate the terms of my existence. Boy, bye.
	comment 48: This seems manipulative.  He WANTS you to be upset. Then you are easier to control..
Seek counselling to figure this out92
	comment 49: makes him feel better to make you feel bad
	comment 50: My go to is a chipper "Let me know if you want to talk about it" and then don't let it bug me.  Because if he's going to be an ass, I will be polite and cordial, as necessary, but if you're going to play childish games, you won't be rewarded with me running after you, giving you the attention of "tell me!"

Dude. Talk when you want. But don't expect me to be sunshine and rainbows about it.
	comment 51: Nobody deserves to be treated that way. If I did that to my wonderful wife of 44 years I would have to learn to sleep with one eye open. I don’t understand why men think it is okay to treat their s.o./spouse this way.
	comment 52: Yeah no way he’d be ok with you being disrespectful to him even if you were sad, in pain or exhausted. He can feel like shit but he needs to be respectful when he communicates his negative feelings.
	comment 53: Give back the same energy. Oh you don’t wanna talk? Ok. Bye loser. 

He’s feeding off putting you in a worried mood. Don’t let him. Rise above it. Laugh at some videos. Play with the kids.
	comment 54: Wow,  so get in the car, and leave him alone.  Go home tonight and tell him that he doesn't get to treat you like that.
	comment 55: Look I get very overstimulated at grocery stores especially if they are busy. My husband knows this and I tell him I need some space if it's bad enough. Icing you out is not okay. Asking for some time alone is but in a respectful way.
	comment 56: Wait until he needs something from you and be gone or ice him. Have a plausible excuse or make up a reason you’re mad at him. Blow tiny infractions out of proportion. Rinse and repeat until you break him. He wants to give you silent treatment for a week, you repay that 2-fold. If he doesn’t get the message, up it to 3-fold. Men understand consequences.  He needs a healthy dose of his own medicine to get right in the head. Stone faced silence. Get mad at every little thing. Make him walk on eggshells for once. Take back your power. Show him you ain’t the one. Give that man baby some tough love
	comment 57: My partner does this. I say, initially, "I don't deserve to be spoken to this way." Then I give them the space they've awkwardly asked for and leave them alone, completed with silent treatment from me, until they pull their head out of their ass.

I don't know what else to do when this happens.
	comment 58: Has he always been like this when he needs “space”? I agree with previous comments, he doesn’t have to be an ass. I like the suggestion of getting out for awhile or going to stay with family, that’s what I’d do.
	comment 59: I wouldn’t put up with that. 

It’s OK for people to need space 
They can say so politely and empathetically, and they can give the reasons why they supposedly need the space 

But the fact that they think they need the space doesn’t mean they get it 

Not when they have children 

They get to check on the situation with the children first they don’t know whether you need space or not. They don’t know what’s been going on they don’t know whether it’s their turn to deal with the kids because you have been dealing with kids and you’re more stressed out than they have ever dreamt of being 
Maybe the situation is we’re both parents need to be present and fully involved 

It’s very nice to space and when you are and not in a relationship and don’t have kids and you need space and you’re not required to be at work and there’s no family emergency you can have space 

Get in a relationship and things change you have obligations to deal with which often override and need for space

Have kids? 
You need space? 
Great maybe you can have some space in 18 or 20 years 
I know that’s not fun and I know that’s stressful but that’s what happens when there are children. 
If there are two adults around, then maybe they can trade it off to a certain extent, but one adult always checks in with the other about how things are going before they make the decision to take the space and they check in with the other adult that is OK to take the space before they take the space 

That’s what adults do no exceptions 

For single parents it can be insanely difficult, unless there’s other family or friends, who are willing to step up and play part of the role of a partner 

This is why I wouldn’t put up with it if I had children in the house 

The children are a joint responsibility and both parents need to be nice to each other as an absolute requirement even when they need space they need to be patient. They need to explain. They need to be aware that they may not get the space they think they need because the kids and what’s going on in the house come first 

Anyone who doesn’t get that hasn’t been introduced to adulthood yet.  

I don’t care how good a provider somebody is or how good they are in other ways 

Being a parent has lots of responsibilities with it, and these responsibilities about being there all the time for your family and only taking space when your family can afford for you to take the space 
Is this bigger responsibility and is every bit as important as being a provider or something 

Most of us resent it strongly it when people who have not yet reached adulthood emotionally think they are good parents or good partners

It’s like “oh, look at me I did one percent of what I need to do so give me all the praise in the world and pretend like I did everything I need to do“

Who has time for an adult that behaves like that?
	comment 60: Not normal. Feels like it’s in the same family as silent treatment, which is often abusive.
	comment 61: Why do they do this? I noticed if I’m friends, co workers or casual acquaintances with someone they treat me really well and with respect, if I start dating them they change and start acting like you’ve just described.

	comment 69: It sounds like you're going through a tough time right now. It's understandable to feel lonely and unloved when your husband is acting cold towards you. It's important to communicate with him and express how his behavior is affecting you. It's possible that he may be dealing with some personal issues that are causing him to distance himself from you. Try to have an open and honest conversation with him when he's in a better mood to see if you can work through whatever is causing this disconnect. Remember to take care of yourself and seek support from friends or family if you need it.

Next time a guy says something like that to you, point out that nothing is stopping him from being a gay male prostitute, since gay men will pay a lot of money for sexual services, too. Oh, what's that you say, fella? You could never do that because you wouldn't feel sexually attracted to the clientele who wanted sex with you? Ah ha, *now* you get it....
	 comment 2: exactly! i get told that all the time like i’m a college student who aspires for a corporate career at some point, no way i’m sabotaging that for a short career that’ll give me nothing but money and trauma.
	 comment 3: 10 yrs? Most porn actresses are 18 to 21 and age out after 21.  The industry eats them up and spits them out.  Most regret it.  They go back to their homes and everyone knows.  They often get addicted to drugs during the lifestyle and they internalize that sex is the only thing worthy about them.  Very, very few have a longer career in porn.  Most are just fodder.
	 comment 4: I have changed my job several times so far, so the 10-year thing isn't a problem for me (but I do understand why for some people/jobs it is important). The main concern is safety. Any woman who is getting into the porn industry/sex work is playing Russian roulette. How can she know for sure, that the people in her job are actually going to pay her, and not enslave her/drug her/sell her off etc.? Even if they pay at the beginning, that might just be a way to get her guards down, and who knows whats next after that. Most women who get into that business probably aren't even aware about these risks in the first place, and many of them get their lack of knowledge taken advantage of in the above mentioned ways. The ones who don't get taken advantage of/get into any trouble, and actually get paid enough to make a living, mostly only know the sex industry from their own successful experience, and remain uninformed about the risks, that's why they are able to make the sex industry seem lucrative. While in reality, they just had luck.
	 comment 5: Not gay male prostitute but gay male porn star.

Let us see his reaction then.

Hope you have alot more to add to the "well, you know it's not the same."
	 comment 8: Yeah nobody is getting paid for sex they *want* to have. 


Plus it's not literally your looks you are getting paid for. Your looks are just a prerequisite. You are getting paid to pretend to like men who are unlikable. That's what the money is actually for. There's this myth that sex workers just have to exist while naked, which is untrue. It's so much more physically exhausting, mentally exhausting, and dignity sapping than that. If any of these men had ever had sex they weren't into, they'd realize how miserable it is. If any of them had to obey the sexual whims of a woman they found repulsive and reassure her that they're totally attracted to her, they'd think twice about their fantasy of being a sex worker.
	comment 9: I've been told that I should make an Onlyfans around twenty times by men I barely know I hate it. It should not be socially acceptable to tell a woman to make porn that's sexual harassment.
	 comment 10: That last part! It is not a compliment or an acceptable question to ask a woman or insist she do porn or any kind of sex-work.
	 comment 11: Back in the days of landlines I had a roommate with a great voice. It sounded normal to me, but male callers would always comment on the fact that she sounded amazing on the phone and that she should do phone sex. 

I never even thought about that until now.
	 comment 12: And then these same men will shame woman who do have an only fans. I don’t know why men think it’s okay to tell a woman that they should start an onlyfans or anything in relation to that. It’s just inappropriate
	 comment 13: It's literally the exact same thing as if these sleazy men asked you to take of your clothes so they could see you naked.  Because that's exactly what they mean.  How there's any social acceptance around such a disgusting comment is beyond me.
	 comment 14: Exactly! It’s sexual harassment!
	 comment 15: These men think they are being so clever in changing the ask for nudes from a personal demand to an impersonal society demand. Doesn’t change the fact that these men are still sexual harassers regardless of trying to make the ask appear impersonal, or vainly trying to appeal to boss girl culture.
	 comment 16: YUP THANK YOU
	 comment 17: What they mean to say is "I'd pay to see you naked and I'm already imagining it. I'm also fishing for info to know if you do have existing nudes I can perv off later. I'm also testing you to see how open you are to this kind of idea and I win regardless of your answer. Either you've got nudes for me or you're grossed out!"

Seriously too many men are just thinking with their peens and it's almost a miracle that they're able to get anything of value done.
	comment 18: Even if you threw all your morals and values aside, I highly doubt every OF content creator is a millionaire. I wonder why men who think making money that way is so smart, easy and safe don't do it themselves.
	 comment 19: The average monthly income of an onlyfans creator is 186 dollars a month.
	 comment 20: A lot of us dream of making male content. Unfortunately there's less of a market for it. If there was half the demand for paid male content as there is for paid female content, I guarantee there'd be an army of dudes signing up. And I'd be leading the charge. 😩
	comment 21: Offering you a job in the sex industry without any prompting on your part should be considered sexual harassment. The funny thing is that the gay sex industry exists, if they think sex work is easy and comfy money nothing is stopping them from throwing their hat into the ring themselves. 

Anyway, I think the psychology behind these men's mentality is that they glamourise the sex industry so that they don't need to feel guilty for partaking in it as consumers and can ignore any ethical concerns ("all these girls probably make more money than I will ever see, so I don't need to feel bad for them while I masturbate to a violent video"). It allows them to mentally bypass the well-documented mechanisms of exploitation in the industry and even to completely invert the relevant power dynamics and position themselves as the real victims of it, see: all the whining about how adult content creators "manipulate" or "trick" men into paying for their content by "taking advantage of male loneliness".

This framework paints the male consumer as a poor down-on-his-luck nice guy who is being financially exploited by women (or sometimes as a great feminist ally who is supporting a woman's business); in both cases the sex worker is portrayed as an all-powerful, economically privileged actor who is *above* the consumer in the social hierarchy and therefore isn't in need of help or empathy. It's all engineered so that they can continue consuming guilt-free. 

(There's also the more purely "MRA" side of things: they need to believe that sex work is a privilege because that means that women in general are privileged because they have the option of embarking upon this scintillating career path, while the poor men are unfortunately robbed of the amazing possibility of being abused, humiliated, stalked and mocked for the rest of their lives even when they've been out of the industry for decades).
	 comment 22: oh my god the way they victimize themselves. truly brain rotted.

the things they said to amouranth after they found out she was essentially being trafficked or pimped by her insanely abusive husband. "We're the real victims here, you didn't tell us you were married".
	 comment 23: THIS.

every word of this.
	 comment 24: Very well stated.
	comment 25: Then, if you were to "make much, much more and have a 'better' life by using your looks" you'd be demonized, maybe even by the same men.
	 comment 26: Demonized by the same men who watch and consume it.
	 comment 27: Exactly what I came here to say. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
	 comment 28: Can confirm
	 comment 29: Well, OF COURSE!  You'd be a HO, you see.

Men fantasize about 'going on the game' and getting paid a fortune for sticking their dick in beautiful women.  THAT is what they think about when they suggest 'sex work' as a viable career.
	comment 30: Wow, tell them "if I was an attractive man like you, I'd make money with gay porn", see how they like it!
	 comment 31: The ironic thing is that most men who do gay porn are actually straight because they make more money. 😂
	 comment 32: Fact: There are enough old gays, who'd crave a young gay. Many old gays make good money too.
	 comment 33: r/goodcomebacks
	 comment 34: This is the worst advice I've ever seen on this sub

> if I was an attractive man like you

NEVER compliment a man.
	comment 35: This kind of suggestion is just not normal in a relationship and should never be tolerated.

There are plenty of 'drop dead gorgeous' women who think like you, the vast majority even.  Ditch these men from your life.
	comment 36: What the fuck.  That's a horrible thing to just tell somebody.

It's not even true.  I know plenty of good looking people who actively \*try\* to get into sex work adjacent stuff like Only Fans who can barely turn a profit from it...and there's not exactly a lot of overhead cost with it.  So they're not just being gross, they're being ignorant.

In this economy if you have an office job you have it made.  There's nothing you can do that's better unless you have bizare luck.
	comment 37: Fuckin hell. As someone who has done OF in the past for years to the point of being top 3%, it’s not as easy as men seem to think; certainly isn’t the key for a “good” stress free life. You’ve got the right idea. Don’t do it. Hope you cut the men off who say this/limit contact as much as possible. 


So to answer the question, I guess yes, I would, but I kind of regret it. I needed the money it brought me, but it has made me harbour a larger disdain for men in general. Again, don’t bother.


Edit: Just to theorise why they romanticise this/think it’s appropriate to suggest to women- as a fair generalisation, men *love* sexual attention. Most can’t even comprehend that we, as women, may not want it 247.
	comment 38: "If i was a attractive women I'd do porn/sex work/etc."

Tell me you have no idea how dangerous it is to be a woman without telling me you have no idea how dangerous it is to be a woman.
	comment 39: If those men think sex work is so good, why don’t they go into it? Getting paid to bone all the chicks they possibly can; who could possibly want anything more?

Oh yeah, it’s because they think it’s beneath them. (And also because it’s actually not enjoyable at all, but they probably don’t know that. Nothing like making something a job to suck all the fun out of it.)
	 comment 40: The market for male heterosexual prostitutes is almost non-existent, they'd have to go gay4pay and they don't want it because they aren't attracted to men (ignoring that female sex workers aren't attracted to the majority of their clients/co-stars either).
	comment 41: They wouldn’t suffer any consequences if you did though and they would be able to access you easier. 

In some places thought history in patriarchal cultures there were social welfare benefits you couldn’t access unless you’ve already tried to sell you wife and your daughter. The program for women was to sell themselves into sex slavery.
	comment 42: I am a medical resident. When I was in college, I studied Japanese because I am a Weeb. One of my ex friends told me I was better off doing fetish porn in Japan than becoming a doctor.
	 comment 43: Personally, when  I need medical treatment I really rather want a doctor - I  do NOT want someone who's spending all their time making porn.  Hit the books, not the sheets!
	comment 44: When admiring the greener grass on the other side, people have a tendency to only consider the most visible and successful examples.  The majority of people who enter sex work will take on all the risk, ridicule and stigma without ever seeing more income that a part time cashier at burger king.
	 comment 45: It's sort of the equivalent to telling someone they should play a sport for a living.  Pro sports stars make so much money!

Yeah and all the college players that went nowhere, short career spans, possibly life changing injuries etc...

Glamorizing the top 1% BS
	comment 46: Sounds like these men are trying to groom you and be your pimp. Stay far away from them.
	comment 47: No, most women who are very attractive are not sex workers. Most women feel exactly the same way you do - there is no amount of money in the world that would make them want to be a sex worker of any kind.  

It is disgusting and predatory of these men to try to convince you that you should entertain sex work as lucrative career option.
	comment 48: There are so many very attractive women who make less than minimum wage on onlyfans.... It's actually work and not easy. Especially when you don't have a niche. 

Just being pretty on the internet isn't valuable at all. If it was that easy so many people would be doing it.
	comment 49: They can go work at a gay bar.  

Back in the day, my sister and her friends brought their gay friend out for his birthday to a male strip joint.  Then the strippers were paying all the attention to the girls and not the birthday boy.

We always used to joke that we were going to try to get jobs at some shirtless gay bar over the summer.  Get ripped, and go serve gay guys.  Those guys make lots of money.
	 comment 50: One of my husbands high school friends did that, then became a stripper, some of the dudebros would hassle him about it. He made bank tho and ended up working as a chippendale’s dancer in Vegas. And he gave Betty White a lap dance on Ellen one time. 🤣 He’s fulfilled by his life choices and some men will always feel threatened. All the women in our group were like hate all you want, he’s out there confident in his body/sexuality not tearing anyone down. That’s one of the most attractive characteristics.
	comment 51: Sounds like a Tate follower. Make a woman fall in love with you and then pimp her out and take all her earnings. Pretty sure he’s awaiting trial for that bullshit.
	comment 52: Men think sex workers enjoy their work. 
Men think women enjoy being assaulted by men.
	 comment 53: Literally. Echoing what I said in another comment: men as a fair generalisation *love* sexual attention. They can’t even comprehend that as women, we may not want it off anyone and everyone.
	comment 54: “If it were me” guys are the best. They all know “for a fact” how they would act in any situation they’ve never been in….whether it’s dating, cancer, or carjacking. Half of these nimrods cant even make a sandwich or bathe properly.

	comment 55: If you really want to fuck with them...

Tell them you used to do porn.  Watch how their reactions change.
	 comment 56: Honestly, theoretically, yes. Practically, no. Far too many women involved or previously involved with this industry face violence from men who think prostitutes/porn actresses are okay to molest or harrass. As far as they're concerned, all women must be sexually available to them, but all women who are sexually available are "asking" for harrasment. Women who've worked in this godawful industry find themselves at a greater risk of violence because men (police) tend to take their complaints less seriously, and men (the people who harrass) know this.
	comment 57: The Post Office is an incredibly important institution, screw those pricks for both being gross and not recognizing the importance of public service.
	comment 58: It's the other way around, it's not "I'm attractive enough that I don't need to do normal work and can do sex work", it's "I'm lucky enough that I have a regular job that pays my bills, so I don't have to rely on sex work".

That's at least how I feel about it. Sure there are women who happily do those jobs, but I think most women are happy that they don't need to consider any options like that.
	 comment 59: Yup!!!

	comment 62: Women understand sexuality being a bad thing a heck of a lot better than men do. Men think it’s just fun sex all the time not the reality of it being middling sex with guys who treat the sex worker like a flashlight.
	comment 63: This wreaks of ignorance. To say that prostitutes have good lives as if everything is hunky-dory is naive; most of these women have been put through hell and consequently have to objectify their bodies to survive. It’s a dangerous job, putting yourself in the most vulnerable position for strange man after strange man hoping they don’t abuse/kill you.

Specific to what OP is saying, it’s so shitty that these men disregard how dehumanizing it is to tell someone to objectify themselves. Like it’s easy, like they already see you as an object, like your objectification is the highest value you could provide to society.
	comment 64: Since when is having a stable government job with good benefits not enough for people? Working for the post office is an amazing gig.
	comment 65: Having read interviews... no, its not an 'easy money' life even when they're good, and mentally and emotionally ready for it; it's a job that's rather demanding on the body in a lot of unanticipated ways, and emotionally stressful.
	comment 66: I'm so sorry. I've experienced this myself. This is why I'm actually against sex work, because if sex is a job then sexual harassment becomes a job offer.

This is also how women are trafficked, I've had men try to get close to me so that they can better "introduce" me to sex work. THIS IS HOW PIMPS WORK.

I have suggested to men that say this to me that they should go sell their assholes. Somehow they don't think that's a very good idea.
	comment 67: I’ve dabbled into these industries and it’s definitely not for everyone. Yea the money is good but it’s soul crushing at times. Men don’t know the effort and energy required to entertain them.
	comment 68: In addition to not being comfortable with it, if I did sex work it would seriously jeopardize my career. I’m a teacher. There have been multiple stories about teachers getting fired for having OnlyFans recently. Also do they not realize that most women who do OF or other sex work make very little money off it? It’s only the top 1% or so that can make a living.
	 comment 69: I understand why schools have policies like this, but it would be nice if they would also fire male teachers that have OnlyFans subscriptions.
	comment 70: Please stop dating pimps. Your self-respect is giving you your best weapon: you are independent and don’t live for men’s validation!
	comment 71: My response to shit like that, or men complaining that women have it "easy" because "they can just make an only fans" is to tell them to fucking do it then. Post their ass online, see just what it's like.

Of course, they don't and won't. the come back is always "Only old gay men would want my ass" and, yeah. That's the fucking point - people you aren't attracted to are going to creep on you. Men live in stupid fucking bubble where they think women in sex work are always being romanced by hot studs they love to fuck - because that's their god damn fantasy.

	comment 76: I was talking to a guy from class and we're friendly towards each other because we often travel together to school by public transport. I somehow ended up asking him the question "what would you do if woke up as the opposite sex for 24 hours?"

I regret asking.
	comment 77: If I was attractive I'd do exactly what I do now, except with less anxiety and self-doubt.
	comment 78: those guys are probably attempting to follow the andrew tate method of talking you into sex work and then taking a massive cut off the profits
	comment 79: I know a few people who have done various levels of sex work, and I think a lot of guys are very misled on how much money there is. Even people who do mainstream work are not absolutely swimming in money and there's usually an upper limit on how long you can do it for. I would never judge anyone for doing it because I think sex work is perfectly valid work if you are not being pressured into it, but people just have such absolutely bonkers viewpoints on this stuff.

Above all else, it's just none of their damn business to even suggest that. A grown woman can decide that for herself and I'm sure in today's world, they are perfectly aware sex work is out there.
	comment 80: So, there’s a practice that is called “Romeo-ing” a woman into the sex trade. That’s when a pimp meets a normal pretty girl and pretends to be interested in dating her. Pretends to love or like her. But then eventually talks her into some form of prostitution. He of course will profit from her sex work. OP, I m an office worker too. And I’ve had 4 men try this game with me. Different approaches each time but the same goal. Times are hard and bottom feeders are desperately looking for a woman to financially care for them while they sit on their asses. Please be careful out there.

Like, DUDE. You KNOW how fucking into video games I am-  Jesus. Fucking Christ. He seriously. Asked. If I had started doing fucking porn. IN FRONT OF HIS KIDS!!!! His fucking DAUGHTER heard him ask me!! I fucking KNEW I got a bad feeling about your nasty fucking ass- so glad my friend got herself AND her kids away from him..

Like WHO THE FUCK ASKS SOMEONE THAT? WhY would your brain immediately jump to porn?? Way to tell me you've been fucking undressing me with your eyes this entire time I've known you without telling me you've been undressing me with your eyes the entire time I've known you.
	comment 83: I think the normalization of sex work is pretty disturbing. One of my closest guy friends suggested I start an onlyfans on a couple occasions and needless to say we are no longer friends. I personally think its coming from a place of hatred for women. I dont think these men actually see us as humans deserving of dignity and respect. It’s just pure selfishness.
	comment 84: They see themselves in the situation, thinking that it would be just as enjoyable as if they were paid to have sex with women.

If only they understood that a man's experience having sex with a woman is entirely different than a woman's experience having sex with a man. The safety risks, the power imbalance, the objecification, the misogyny, the orgasm gap ...
	comment 85: Even aside from all other issues with saying stuff like that (and there are plenty), the idea that merely being attractive is an instant ticket to success in the sex industry is laughable. There’s an absurd amount of luck involved just like any media career, not to mention the work (and I mean besides the posting itself. The ancillary stuff like marketing, curating content, etc as well).
	comment 86: I tell them to suggest those careers to their mother and sisters and be sure to raise their daughters (if they’re attractive enough ofc) to seek out those professions. And if they get upset, ask them why they’re upset? What you can’t take a joke? Why are you getting so emotional?
	comment 87: These are the same men that shame women in that industry and say “ don’t you have any real talent besides your looks” blah blah. They don’t have much intelligence or moral values and have no idea what it’s actually like to be a woman, especially an attractive one at that. It’s actually very difficult sometimes ! Ignore these idiots and continue on with your life, sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders so keep doing what you’re doing :)
	comment 88: They are predators.
	comment 89: yeah, these are the same men who will scam you for free services even if you are doing sex work. there's no winning with these losers either way; hit right click and recycle bin their existence in your mind tbh
	comment 90: Uhh, this is so much coming from people who dont know what its like. I tried this when I got single, just because people had been telling me. Albeit I am a make, I can tell you it sucks. If you fuck someone for money, and not out of lust, you will be having every single moment of it.

Took me years to actually enjoy sex again, and to this day i find porn disgusting. Which i didn't before.

Please, never engage in sexwork unless you absolutely have to. It fucks you up!
	comment 91: These aren't normal men, these are predators.
	comment 92: Burn these men and find a coven. 

Honestly they are doing you no favours by saying you can get by on your looks. I'm sure you're gorgeous, but it's very demeaning of them to say that your looks are your only asset that you can sell for loads of money. You have plenty of skills and if you want to use them to make extra income then do, but if not then don't. Fuck those guys seriously what fucking assholes.
	comment 93: This is projection. THEY would totally do it. They WISH they had an option like that.

Men envy women. They hate them as well and would love to corrupt you, so you'd become more controllable through shame and accessible as a sex toy. Look up bimbofication fetish, it is the extreme version of the feelings that are in such comments.

Your last bf advicing you to do OF instead of him figuring out how to provide better is 🤮 


Basically, those men are trash💁
	comment 94: One thing is that I would assume a random guy who was trying to recruit me to be introduced to complete strangers about a sex thing might be doing sex trafficking or some other kind of nefarious shit
	comment 95: That's their tact lol

Don't think they are praising you are something
Actually they are trying to undermine you.
	comment 96: Nothing wrong with sex work if a woman feels empowered to do it. However, it’s not right to push that on anyone. You don’t just create an onlyfans account and suddenly make lots of money. It’s hard work and dangerous and certainly not for everyone.
	comment 97: Anybody who thinks a sex worker who makes decent money is doing an easy job has never met a sex worker in real life. It is ridiculously hard and emotionally draining, and being constantly subjected to abuse from men is not fun at all. Very few women are able to make a decent living from sex work because it is not something that most women are well suited to.

Or leave out the thank you

If you come up with something snarky and clever, that’s even better

	comment 112: When I was in college I had a stripper roommate and got to know many of her friends. (This was an age before OF, before escorts could advertise on Craigslist, etc). Yes they could make a lot of money in a short amount of time dancing, but it was a crapshoot and it definitely demoralized their attitude towards men. Much of their money went back into clothing, hair, nails, and some invested in cosmetic surgery to try to make more. I kept contact with her after we moved out, and she switched to phone sex when she got pregnant, the stories she told about what men wanted were vile. Fast fwd some decades, none of those women are wealthy now. My ex roommate ended up in a relationship with one of those girls she worked with, and they are scrapping by. 

It takes a lot of work to have a safe and successful sex worker career, and it’s definitely not for everyone. People in it see a lot and it can be hard to not get jaded, and it’s a career with an expiration date for most people. I’m not saying it’s bad to get into, some find it liberating and it’s a service that will always be in demand, just saying it’s not the ‘easy money’ men think it is.
	comment 113: Aside from stating the obvious; not a career, you essentially just screw yourself out of getting a legit job in the future, having to deal with sickos and/or potential stalkers, privacy will be an actual luxury....

He says "Why not just do porn/escort/etc?". Okay. Will he want to date you still if you are showing off or giving your body away to all these other guys? No. That'll just make you a "slut" in his eyes now. There would be no winning here. If he's complaining about money, he can go find a better job and get some himself. If he's still thinking along the lines of what you should do with yourself in that kind of way, he is not ready for a mature relationship, and I'd really question how he views women.
	comment 114: I don’t think it’s ignorance.

They want you to give them a reason to disrespect you. Because they want to be allowed to call you a ** but right now you are a normal person working at the post office. They would prefer for you to be a product they can objectify and call names. Because “you asked for it” by signing up.

I really don’t think anyone genuinely thinks this is a good “career opportunity”. 

It’s like if men complained about making little money and we told them, why don’t you become a miner or logger or work in an oil rig or sign up with the army or start selling hard drugs. (And these are all much safer and better paid than prostitution). 

Also, when someone says they want to introduce you. worse case: Human trafficker, best case: pimp. Either way, illegal in us? So report this person if possible and stay away.
	comment 115: Need to come home and relax? Relaxing at home is the goal. Sounds like they were sources of stress.
	comment 116: It is unfortunate that you have experienced this kind of pressure and disrespect from the men in your life. It is important to remember that your worth and value as a person is not determined by your looks or your job. You have the right to choose the path that makes you happy and fulfilled, and it is clear that sex work is not something that aligns with your values and beliefs. Many women, like yourself, choose to pursue meaningful and fulfilling careers that do not rely on their physical appearance. It is important to stand firm in your beliefs and not allow others to dictate what is best for you. You are not alone in feeling this way, and there are many women who share your perspective. It is important to surround yourself with people who respect and support your choices.

Her looks have no bearing on why I hired her, it’s because she’s good at her job and I’ll always hire a woman if I can. I love that she does that job and doesn’t care about looking a certain way. She repaired our super old gas dryer cheaply and it still works great.
	comment 118: Should tell those guys there's absolutely nothing stopping them from starting an Onlyfans catering to guys, I'm sure there are any number of horny dudes would pay to see them objectify themselves.
	comment 119: That's such an ignorant view. They don't know the first thing about sex work if they think it's easy money.
	comment 120: So, there’s a practice that is called “Romeo-ing” a woman into the sex trade. That’s when a pimp meets a normal pretty girl and pretends to be interested in dating her. Pretends to love or like her. But then eventually talks her into some form of prostitution. He of course will profit from her sex work. OP, I m an office worker too. And I’ve had 4 men try this game with me. Different approaches each time but the same goal. Times are hard and bottom feeders are desperately looking for a woman to financially care for them while they sit on their asses. Please be careful out there.

	comment 124: I don't think those men understand how little most woman in it make from pornography. Seems to be that the people who make significant money from porn are the web site owners and to a lesser degree the photographers. It seems like most women who it, do it for a few years and then move on with their lives.
	comment 125: Those fools need a reality check. Plenty of documentaries says otherwise and only a few have "breakout" careers.

	comment 128: Let me just start off by saying that I'm sorry you have dealt with so many shitty people trying to tell you what to do with your life. I don't care if they are trying to tell you to be a sex worker or trying to tell you that you should get into any industry, it's your life and it is your choice what you pursue and they can go lick a slimy turd.

So on to the.. topic.
I can only guess so I would highly suggest that anyone who reads my words takes them with like a bunch of salt lol

I have to imagine that the way that one views sex work is highly dependent on their upbringing and men are brought up with sex in the forefront of their consciousness because that's what society teaches them.

I would expect that the effect that sex work would have on a person's mental well-being would be dependent on how they feel about sex work in general. If a person were raised to believe that sex work is empowering then I believe that they would feel empowered performing sex work but if they were raised to believe that it is a lowly position, performed only by desperate people who have nothing else to offer then it would be harmful to that person's psyche.

I know that there are many people who believe that we are born with some kind of intrinsic qualities baked into our being but that's a bunch of malarkey lol we learn based on what we are taught and exposed to and the earlier we are exposed to something the more normalized it becomes.

Anywho... I hope that this answer is like at least somewhat appreciated and not just bothersome and I hope that whoever reads it goes on to have a lovely day despite the somber topic.

	comment 139: Honestly I would happily do porn if it wasn’t stigmatized so much. I’ve been at a few places in my life when I almost did because I really, really needed the money. I did strip at these private invite only parties for a little while but it felt gross and I wasn’t making enough to justify how gross I felt. At least in porn everyone is a professional…
	 comment 140: "At least in porn everyone is a professional" is a lie. I don't know which studios you've looked at, but porn shoots are extremely unprofessional and have been dangerous for many women. [link](https://www.remojo.com/post/the-dark-side-of-porn-whats-really-going-on-behind-the-scenes)
	comment 141: Don't shame sex workers. You can not want to do that work but you don't have to say you find it disgusting. Men will tell you that getting OF, working in full service, porn or stripping is a lucrative business until you do work in that buisness and then suddenly it isn't a job anymore and you're lazy. It's only a job to them when they're benefiting from your labor or getting a cut of your profits. 

Men are looking for an excuse to profit off  of your looks and sexually exploit you which is a very classic move for them but it doesn't make people who actually work in that industry as lesser than. 

Sex work is never easy money and your ex boyfriend is a fucking idiot for thinking that it is. Most women don't automatically use their looks and sexualized position in society to profit but you can't blame them when they do. 

For reference: im a stripper after working in the care industry for years!. But it didn't pay my bills. Stripping does. So I do that and it is NOT EASY. In fact  it is one of the hardest jobs I've had. And I used to clean out adult diapers. 

This job gives me financial security and more luxury but it comes at a huge price. It's a price I'm willing to pay but a lot of women could never do this job and there's no shame in that. Looks has a lot less to do with it than you think. Men would fuck a jar of mayonnaise. 

Don't call sex work disgusting. If you don't want to do it, then don't.
	 comment 142: Nobody here called sex workers disgusting but it's entirely appropriate to have the opinion that sex work is not something a woman would consider doing regardless of what adjectives are used to describe that feeling.
	 comment 143: She finds it disgusting for her.  

Don’t shame women who don’t like sex work for themselves 

Women have the absolute right to have sexual boundaries 

And these men who speak to her like that are objectifying her.
	 comment 144: to what degree is it ok to voice a personal opinion?
	comment 145: Eh, depends on the individual. It's definitely not for everyone, but I met a girl in Vegas who was doing it to put herself through law school. Power to her, I say. Especially in places where you can do it safely and legally.

But I don't think anyone "should" do that if they don't want to, anymore than a guy should play basketball just because he's tall or be a linebacker because he's built like a gorilla or whatever.

You do you, and don't let others make you feel bad or weird for it.

	comment 149: Firstly, being "beautiful" is not enough or necessary to be in porn industry. You also need to lack dignity and be a woman without principles which, perhaps, are values you don't align with and that's totally fine. Life moves on. 

Secondly, if i were you, i'd revise the type of men I hang out with. For some reason you seem to pick the ones that aren't capable enough to put you on a right path.

Thirdly, humbleness is ok as long as it's a trait, not a state.

Hope this helps,

Just another man

	 comment 151: OP doesn't need any man to "set her on the right path," she needs prospective pimps to stop harassing her. Including her "boyfriend."  
The word you're looking for is "humility," not "humbleness."

First of all, it’s hard work. Yes, good looks are part of it, but you also need to create content basically constantly. Not in the mood? Too bad, you need to keep your audience hooked.

Next, it’s a damned if you do, damned if you don’t kinda Situation. If you don’t do OF you get what OP describes, but if you do your labeled a slur and attention seeking.

Also, content creation is hard work if you want to do it properly. You need to think about how you present stuff, what your target audience is, etc.

Finally and most importantly, it’s just not for everyone. If it’s for you and you like doing it, more power to you, but if you don’t, then there is no reason someone should tell you to do it anyway. I’m good in IT stuff and could have a good life as an admin, but I’d rather do Programming than IT. Just because I theoretically have an advantage in one thing doesn’t mean I have to do it if it doesn’t make me happy.
	comment 159: I was trafficked into the sex industry in my teens. I managed to leave that situation a number of years later, but due to certain factors from my childhood and the abuse in being in sexual slavery, I believed I wasn't any good for anything else... so I continued. I got out in my mid 30s due a mental breakdown and found myself with no tertiary education, nothing I could put on resume, and no mainstream experience (don't worry, I got myself to uni and turned my life around)

Ok, so my point is: I know what I'm talking about. It takes a certain kind of person to succeed in sex work, and the factors involved in that are completely situational and individual. For me, it was an ability to separate sex at work from sex outside work; the ability to effectively 'dissociate' to the point of no emotion; the ability to talk to people on a wide variety of subjects on a wide variety of levels; the ability to see myself as the product, sell my services, and know my best attributes (physical and mental); the fact that I grew up without an emotional attachment to sex acts (in other words, I never learned that sex was something that was precious and should only be done with people you love)... and (your gonna love this one) no gag reflex 

I did find empowerment, freedom, and self esteem through the industry. In the end, I worked in multiple countries across the world, made a fuck-ton of money, enjoyed travel, clothes, cars, fine food... I do have to put a rider on this: I was conventionally very attractive. I was extremely lucky that I won the genetic lottery in both looks and intelligence, and including the factors above, made me uniquely suited to sex work

The life is not for everyone. In fact, I'd say there is only a small amount of people who can do the job successfully. All those men who say they would do it if they were women are completely ignorant of the industry, and are lying. I find it highly disturbing that these men see you in this way. It says a lot more about them than about you

I would not recommend it to just anyone. ***I do not recommend it to you***

I am certainly not saying that my experience is universal; quite the opposite. My aim was to show you that only a tiny, miniscule percentage of the population is actually suited to this

	comment 161: Charming people. They could at least have said modelling if they thought you ought to make money of your good looks.
	comment 162: Reminds me there was a girl in my high school who some of my "friends" (more like the separate friend group of one guy who was actually one of my friends) called "porn \[name\]" behind her back because they think she looked like a porn star. Shocked me the first time I heard it.  Sufficient to say I told them off and then hung around those people a lot less. I hope I would have done it if it didn't happen to have a crush on the girl in question... so who know maybe I was just white knighting.
	comment 163: Me as a man doesn’t understand these man either. I’d like to believe these man do not represent us man in general.

	comment 167: I am very confident that men who say this, especially when they become pushy, are looking to have another human under their control and their plan is to be the one making the money whilst the other person becomes an indentured servant under their supposed ‘guidance’.
	comment 168: “As if you’d be able to afford me.” That’s my go-to response.


Any man telling you that you should do porn/prostitution is being loud about the fact that he wants to have sexual access to you. They think they’ve found a sly way of telling you to your face that they’re imagining you naked. 


Another good one is “Sorry to hear you failed out of your dream career. Not everyone can be good in bed.”


But you can only quip back like that if you’re ready and able to stand your ground and maintain a condescending, disinterested attitude. Sometimes they shut up right away, but sometimes they try and bite back and you’ve gotta be ready to keep insulting them. Because they know what they’re saying is gross, that’s the point: they was to make you uncomfortable and exert power over you because they’re upset that they are attracted to you and have no way to obtain you. Hence why they’re fantasizing about being able to purchase your company.

Some cases you might find useful:

* 2015 case (Regina v Bell) where the offender was given life in prison for raping someone in their sleep ( [https://crimeline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bell.pdf](https://crimeline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bell.pdf) )
* A 2020 note about the Court of Appeal clarifying for the Attorney-General that the offender's intent didn't have to be proven to be sexual in order to secure a conviction ( [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-clarifies-law-on-sexual-assault](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-clarifies-law-on-sexual-assault) ).
* A 2019 case where a woman had given consent to sexual activities, but when the offender penetrated her in a way she hadn't consented to, he was found guilty of rape (Withdrawing conset during sex case study: [https://www.cps.gov.uk/news/prosecuting-complex-rape-cases-case-studies](https://www.cps.gov.uk/news/prosecuting-complex-rape-cases-case-studies) )

I hope you have a support network you can surround yourself with.

I'm so, so sorry.
	 comment 2: Thank you so much, I really appreciate it
	comment 3: I would definitely advise reaching out to any charities that support SA/DV victims that could provide legal advice/advocacy in going through the legal and/or complaints process. They may be able to help you with information and resources and making sure your complaints go to the right people, and help you with trying again to speak to police. Potentially providing support and advocacy in many other areas too.

I know the idea of reaching out to people about this may seem scary but in my experience most charity workers in this sector are very trauma informed (much more so than your average police officer) compassionate and may have good links to research/data also.

I’m so sorry this has happened to you. Unfortunately the UK has a fucking abysmal prosecution rate for rape and sexual assault.
	 comment 4: Thank you, I’ll try. I have already emailed a charity for help as I have a hidden disability which I feel like wasn’t taken into account either. 

Unfortunately my ISVA seems to have changed her tune as well, she’s meant to provide me with any support and advice but when I brought up valid points about the messages and me clearly not consenting, she just said “the police can’t do anything.” … I feel like everyone’s against me and I’m really not sure why.
	comment 5: My ex is a cop. Did you know that domestic violence rates are especially high among cops? The reason they think what he did is ok is because they think the same way. There’s not much you can say that will change their point of view.
	comment 6: I’m trying to understand, so I read your story again from the police’s perspective. I think they were looking for you to say that you verbalized resistance. The guy might have told his story and said that you never told him to stop. So he may have influenced prosecutors against you before you they interviewed you.

I understand your story. You were hurt, and the guy who hurt you had to know this. It’s not a mistake, it was an attack. I believe you. 

I definitely believe you.
	 comment 7: Thank you, the other issue is however they never even interviewed him, they’ve not looked at the messages where he admits what he did … I made a post on my other account on a police sub and got told that even just my allegation would be enough to interview him?
	comment 8: My best advice is to lawyer up.
	comment 9: This is a very confusing direction for them to have taken. Within such a short summary, you have allegations of quite serious DA (domestic assault) related to coercive and controlling behaviour, sexual assault, and rape. Physically saying "no" is not required for denying consent, especially if you are alleging the coercive and controlling elements. DA related cases are one of the highest priorities in UK policing, and one of the most heavily scrutinised, and while they may not get a chargeable case out of it, there is a positive action policy towards DA that this is in clear breach of. Complain initially through the complaints process for your force, but reach out to to local MP (as embarrassing as that may feel, which I understand, they are likely to have a direct line to upper police management for your local force, and that'll kick the scrutiny into gear). This may not change the outcome, but you may get some additional clarity .

	comment 1: There’s a whiff of desperation off him resorting to negging you. 

Even if you were his type, what made him presume he’d be your choice? Delusional. 

How frustrating he can’t just appreciate your help and value your friendship. He doesn’t respect you as a peer so stop helping him. Don’t do shit for his benefit, if you can avoid it. He would throw you under a bus for an opportunity. If anything, the negging is a compliment, he’s likely threatened by your superiority; academically and physically.

Some men can’t wrap their heads around non transactional acts of kindness. Their loss.
	 comment 2: He tried to lecture me about how to have more success with dating men after I showed him what kind of messages do I get from the average man on social media (nasty ones). He seemed so bothered by the fact that I am single at the moment...
	 comment 3: >Even if you were his type, what made him presume he’d be your choice? Delusional. 

This has happened to me. Twice. Both times, I was in a committed relationship with someone who somehow wasn't "good enough" for me(??), and both times I had the same reaction: "Even if I WAS single, what makes you think I'm remotely attracted or interested in YOU?"

One of the main reasons I'm married to the person I am married to is because he had an equal split of male to female friends. A small handful of those female friends he had previously been intimate with on some level, but like, it was in the past, mutual, and he valued them and continued to value them as human beings who he loved and cared about. It was a HUGE green flag that he was able to maintain multiple platonic friendships with women.

These dudes did not understand that I cared about them as people and took my friendship as an invitation to break me up with my SO so they could have me. They didn't understand why my SO let me hang out with them without him around. They thought he was being naive, I guess. And thought for some reason they... "deserved" me more than him as if I was an object to be won.

It's super strange, entitled, and misogynistic behavior. Also fucking gross.
	 comment 4: Because men like this can't wrap their heads around the idea of being nice or helpful to someone of the opposite sex unless they wanted to fuck them. Because they never would.

	 comment 8: I think it’s either a low-key cheater or he’s one of those men who doesn’t see women as people unless they’re in a relationship with other men. Possibly both. 

Either way, he’s earned himself a trip to the sun bin and he earned it all by himself.
	comment 9: It’s because men don’t help or pay attention to women they aren’t interested in, so they assumed you’re interested in them lol
	 comment 10: It makes me feel less than a human having valued first off all based on my looks. It is even more sad if I think about all the posts about man not getting noticed by woman and lacking physical contact. They forget that if the woman dares to be less appealing to them, she will must likely be treated like shit. I tried to explain him why his behaviour was wrong, but instead of recognising that he was a huge jerk, he blamed it all on his "word view" and "humor".

It's unfortunate that it almost seems to be working in the sense that for a moment it made you doubt yourself? Don't buy into it they are doing this in part as a form of" ego protection " maybe they can't stand that they feel" upstaged by a girl" and are trying to" take you down a peg".

	comment 18: I feel like he was trying to keep you in his back pocket for later.
	 comment 19: It is just a speculation but he might have been to affraid to brake up with his girlfriend in order to pursue me. At that event he spoke about his girlfriend's condition which prevents them from having penetrative intercourse. It was an out of space comment. I haven't made the connection at that moment, but now all adds up.
	comment 20: I'm confused he asked you out while having a girlfriend? Also why does his friend matter?
	 comment 21: Because his friend also belongs to the same program, so I saw him just as much. About his girlfriend... I asked him about the reason, and he told me that he felt free to do so, because he found me a person worth to getting known better. This sounds good on paper, but his actions made me rethink his true intentions.

	comment 4: Okay, so....TMI ahead! 

This is relatable!! I have gastroparesis (caused by a connective tissue disorder), so I don't go very often (once a week or less) and when I do, it's usually a 45-minute struggle. Eating more fiber/veggies/whatever will just make it worse, and Mirilax doesnt work at all. When the period poops happen, it's like a relief I've never known!
	 comment 5: Have you tried a squatty potty?
